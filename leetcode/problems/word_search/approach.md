# Approach

To determine if a word exists in a grid, we need to search for a path through adjacent cells that forms the word.

## Strategy
This problem can be solved using backtracking with a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We'll try to find the word starting from each cell in the grid.

## Steps
1. Iterate through each cell in the grid as a potential starting point.
2. For each starting cell, perform a depth-first search to check if the word can be formed:
   - If the current character matches the next character in the word, continue the search.
   - Mark the current cell as visited to avoid using it again in the same path.
   - Recursively search in all four adjacent directions (up, down, left, right).
   - If any recursive call returns true, the word exists.
   - Unmark the current cell (backtrack) before returning.
3. If no starting point leads to a complete match, return false.

## Implementation Details
- We need to keep track of visited cells to avoid using the same cell multiple times in a path.
- The search should terminate early if:
   - The current character doesn't match the next character in the word.
   - We've gone out of bounds of the grid.
   - We've already visited the current cell in the current path.
- We can use a 2D array or modify the original grid to mark visited cells.

## Pseudocode
```
function exist(board, word):
    for i from 0 to board.rows - 1:
        for j from 0 to board.cols - 1:
            if dfs(board, word, i, j, 0):
                return true
    return false

function dfs(board, word, i, j, k):
    if k == word.length:
        return true
    if i < 0 or i >= board.rows or j < 0 or j >= board.cols or board[i][j] != word[k] or board[i][j] is visited:
        return false
    
    mark board[i][j] as visited
    
    found = dfs(board, word, i+1, j, k+1) or
            dfs(board, word, i-1, j, k+1) or
            dfs(board, word, i, j+1, k+1) or
            dfs(board, word, i, j-1, k+1)
    
    unmark board[i][j] (backtrack)
    
    return found
```

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * 4^L) where N is the number of cells in the grid and L is the length of the word. In the worst case, we might need to explore all four directions for each character in the word.
- **Space Complexity**: O(L) for the recursion stack, where L is the length of the word.
