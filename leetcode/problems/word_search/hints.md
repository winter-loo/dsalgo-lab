# Hints for Word Search

1. This problem can be solved using backtracking with a depth-first search (DFS) approach.

2. Start by iterating through each cell in the grid as a potential starting point for the word.

3. For each starting point, perform a DFS to check if the word can be formed by traversing adjacent cells.

4. Remember that adjacent cells are only those that are horizontally or vertically neighboring (not diagonally).

5. Keep track of visited cells to avoid using the same cell more than once in a single path. You can use a separate visited matrix or modify the original board temporarily.

6. The search should terminate early if:
   - The current character doesn't match the next character in the word.
   - You've gone out of bounds of the grid.
   - You've already visited the current cell in the current path.

7. Don't forget to unmark cells as visited when backtracking (when a path doesn't lead to a solution).

8. Consider optimizations like checking if the board contains all characters in the word before starting the search.
