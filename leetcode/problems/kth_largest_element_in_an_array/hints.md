# Hints for Kth Largest Element in an Array

1. The simplest approach is to sort the array and return the kth element from the end, but the problem asks if you can solve it without sorting.

2. Consider using a heap data structure. A min-heap of size k can efficiently track the k largest elements.

3. The QuickSelect algorithm is an optimized approach for this problem with an average time complexity of O(n).

4. In the QuickSelect algorithm, you only need to partition the array and recurse into one side, unlike QuickSort which recurses into both sides.

5. Remember that the problem is asking for the kth largest element, not the kth distinct largest element. Duplicates count as separate elements.
