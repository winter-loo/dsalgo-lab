# Hints for Missing Number

1. Think about what mathematical property you can use to find the missing number in a sequence.

2. Consider using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This gives you the expected sum of all numbers from 0 to n.

3. If you know the expected sum and the actual sum of the array, the difference is the missing number.

4. Alternatively, consider using bit manipulation. XOR has properties that can be useful for this problem.

5. Remember that XOR of a number with itself is 0, and XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.

6. If you XOR all numbers from 0 to n and all numbers in the array, the missing number will be the result.

7. Another approach is to use a hash set to keep track of the numbers in the array, and then check which number from 0 to n is not in the set.

8. If you're allowed to sort the array, you can use binary search to find the missing number.

9. The solution should have O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity to meet the follow-up requirement.

10. Be careful with potential integer overflow when calculating the sum, especially for large values of n.
