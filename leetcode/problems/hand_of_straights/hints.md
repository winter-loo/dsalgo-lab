# Hints for Hand of Straights

1. Think about how to determine if it's possible to form groups of consecutive cards, each of size `groupSize`.

2. Consider sorting the cards first to make it easier to identify consecutive sequences.

3. Use a hash map or frequency counter to keep track of how many of each card value you have.

4. Process the cards in ascending order (smallest to largest) to ensure you're forming consecutive groups.

5. For each card value, if you have any remaining, you must start a new group with this card as the smallest value.

6. When starting a new group with a card value `x`, you need to check if you have cards with values `x+1`, `x+2`, ..., `x+groupSize-1`.

7. If any card in the required sequence is missing or has been used up, it's impossible to form the groups.

8. Remember to decrement the frequency of each card as you use it in a group.

9. The total number of cards must be divisible by `groupSize` for it to be possible to form the groups.

10. Consider edge cases like when `groupSize` is 1 (any hand is valid) or when the hand contains duplicate values.
