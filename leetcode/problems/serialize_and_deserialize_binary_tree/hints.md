# Hints for Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

1. Think about which traversal method would be most suitable for serialization and deserialization (preorder, level-order, etc.).

2. Remember to include null nodes in your serialized string to preserve the tree structure.

3. Use a delimiter (like comma) to separate node values in the serialized string.

4. For deserialization, you'll need to parse the string and reconstruct the tree following the same traversal order used in serialization.

5. Consider using a queue or index pointer to keep track of the current position in the token list during deserialization.

6. Test your implementation with various tree structures, including empty trees, single-node trees, and trees with null nodes.
