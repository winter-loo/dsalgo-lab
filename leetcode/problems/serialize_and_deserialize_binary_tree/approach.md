# Approach

To serialize and deserialize a binary tree, we need to convert the tree structure into a string format and then be able to reconstruct the original tree from that string.

## Strategy
- Use a traversal method (like preorder, level-order, etc.) to visit all nodes in the tree.
- Include null pointers in the serialized string to preserve the tree structure.
- Use a delimiter to separate node values in the serialized string.
- For deserialization, parse the string and reconstruct the tree following the same traversal order.

## Steps for Serialization
1. Choose a traversal method (preorder is often simple and effective).
2. Traverse the tree and append each node's value to the result string.
3. Use a special marker (like "null" or "#") for null nodes.
4. Use a delimiter (like comma) to separate values.

## Steps for Deserialization
1. Split the serialized string into tokens using the delimiter.
2. Recursively build the tree following the same traversal order used in serialization.
3. Use a queue or index pointer to keep track of the current position in the token list.

## Implementation Options
- **Preorder Traversal**: Simple to implement and efficient for many tree structures.
- **Level-order Traversal**: Good for visualizing the tree structure but may include more null markers.
- **Custom Format**: You can design your own format as long as it preserves all the necessary information.
