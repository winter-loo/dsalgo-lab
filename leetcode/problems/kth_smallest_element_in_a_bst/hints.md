# Hints for Kth Smallest Element in a BST

1. Think about the properties of a binary search tree. What order do elements appear when traversing in-order?
2. In-order traversal of a BST yields elements in ascending order.
3. You can use a recursive or iterative approach for the in-order traversal.
4. Keep a counter to track how many nodes you've visited during the traversal.
5. For the follow-up question, consider augmenting each node with additional information about the size of its subtrees.
