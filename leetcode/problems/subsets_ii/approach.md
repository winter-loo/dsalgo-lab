# Approach

To generate all possible subsets of an array that may contain duplicates, we need to modify our approach from the original Subsets problem to handle duplicates properly.

## Strategy
Similar to the original Subsets problem, we can use backtracking, but with additional considerations to avoid duplicate subsets.

## Steps
1. Sort the input array. This is crucial for handling duplicates efficiently.
2. Use a recursive backtracking function to explore all possible subsets:
   - Add the current subset to the result.
   - For each element starting from the current index:
     - Skip duplicates at the same level of recursion to avoid duplicate subsets.
     - Add the current element to the subset.
     - Recursively explore with the updated subset, starting from the next index.
     - Remove the current element from the subset (backtrack).

## Implementation Details
- Sorting the array allows us to easily identify duplicates (adjacent elements with the same value).
- To avoid duplicate subsets, we skip elements that are the same as the previous element at the same level of recursion.
- We include the empty subset by adding the current subset to the result at the beginning of each recursive call.

## Pseudocode
```
function backtrack(nums, start_index, current_subset, result):
    add a copy of current_subset to result
    
    for i from start_index to nums.length - 1:
        // Skip duplicates at the same level
        if i > start_index and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue
        
        add nums[i] to current_subset
        backtrack(nums, i+1, current_subset, result)
        remove nums[i] from current_subset (backtrack)
```

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * 2^n) where n is the length of the input array. This is because there are potentially 2^n subsets, and it takes O(n) time to create each subset.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the recursion stack and the current subset, plus O(n * 2^n) to store all subsets in the worst case.
