# Hints for Subsets II

1. This problem is similar to the original Subsets problem, but with the added complexity of handling duplicates in the input array.

2. Sort the input array first. This helps in handling duplicates by making them adjacent in the array.

3. Use a backtracking approach to generate all possible subsets systematically.

4. To avoid duplicate subsets, skip elements that are the same as the previous element at the same level of recursion.

5. The key insight is to distinguish between using the first occurrence of a duplicate element and using subsequent occurrences. You should always consider the first occurrence, but only consider subsequent occurrences if you've used the previous occurrence.

6. Remember to include the empty subset in your result.

7. Consider using a set data structure to automatically handle duplicates, but be aware that this might be less efficient than handling duplicates directly in your algorithm.
