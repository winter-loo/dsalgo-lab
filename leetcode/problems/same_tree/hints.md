# Hints for Same Tree

1. Use a recursive approach to compare the trees node by node.
2. Remember to check both structure and values.
3. Two trees are the same if they are both null, or they have the same value and their left and right subtrees are the same.
4. Consider edge cases like one tree being null while the other is not.
