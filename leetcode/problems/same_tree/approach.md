# Approach

To determine if two binary trees are the same, we need to check that they have the same structure and the same node values.

## Strategy
- Use a recursive approach to compare corresponding nodes in both trees.
- Two trees are the same if:
  1. Both are null (base case)
  2. Both have the same value at the current node
  3. Their left subtrees are the same
  4. Their right subtrees are the same

## Steps
1. If both trees are null, return true.
2. If one tree is null and the other is not, return false.
3. If the values of the current nodes are different, return false.
4. Recursively check if the left subtrees are the same.
5. Recursively check if the right subtrees are the same.
6. Return true if both left and right subtrees are the same.
