# Hints for Min Cost Climbing Stairs

1. Think of the problem as a dynamic programming problem where you need to make a decision at each step.

2. At each step, you need to decide whether to take one step or two steps forward, based on which choice minimizes the total cost.

3. Remember that you can start from either index 0 or index 1, so you'll need to consider both starting positions.

4. For each position, the minimum cost to reach the top is the cost of the current step plus the minimum of the costs to reach the top from the next one or two steps.

5. Consider using an array where dp[i] represents the minimum cost to reach the top from position i.

6. The base cases are simple: the cost to reach the top from the top is 0, and the cost from the second-to-last step is just the cost of that step.

7. For optimization, notice that you only need to keep track of the minimum costs for the next two steps at each position, not the entire array.

8. Be careful with the indexing, especially when handling the final step (which is beyond the last element in the cost array).
