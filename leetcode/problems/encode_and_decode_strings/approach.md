# Approach: Length Prefixing with Delimiter

## Intuition
The main challenge in this problem is to encode a list of strings into a single string in such a way that we can unambiguously decode it back to the original list. The key insight is that we need a way to determine where each string begins and ends in the encoded string.

## Algorithm

### Approach 1: Length Prefixing
1. For each string in the input list, prepend the length of the string followed by a delimiter (e.g., '#').
2. Concatenate all these length-prefixed strings to form the encoded string.
3. When decoding, read the length prefix, extract the corresponding number of characters, and repeat until the entire encoded string is processed.

### Approach 2: Escaping Special Characters
1. Choose a special character as a delimiter (e.g., '\n').
2. Escape this character in the original strings by replacing it with a sequence (e.g., '\n' -> '\\n').
3. Join all strings with the delimiter.
4. When decoding, split by the delimiter and unescape the special characters.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n) for both encoding and decoding, where n is the total length of all strings
  - We process each character exactly once
  
- Space Complexity: O(n) for both encoding and decoding
  - We need to store the encoded string and the decoded list of strings

## Implementation Notes
- Be careful with edge cases like empty strings or strings containing the delimiter
- For the length prefixing approach, ensure that the length can be unambiguously parsed
- For the escaping approach, make sure to handle all possible escape sequences correctly
