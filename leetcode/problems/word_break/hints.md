# Hints for Word Break

1. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming, where you build up the solution by checking if substrings can be segmented.

2. Consider using a boolean array dp where dp[i] represents whether the substring s[0...i-1] can be segmented into dictionary words.

3. The base case is dp[0] = true, which means an empty string can always be segmented.

4. For each position i, check all previous positions j where dp[j] is true. If the substring s[j...i-1] is in the dictionary, then dp[i] = true.

5. You can also think of this problem as a graph traversal, where each position in the string is a node, and there's an edge from position i to position j if the substring s[i...j-1] is in the dictionary.

6. Using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, start from position 0 and try to reach position n (the end of the string).

7. To optimize the solution, consider using a set or a trie data structure for the dictionary to speed up word lookups.

8. Be careful with the indices when checking substrings - make sure you're correctly extracting the substring from the original string.

9. Remember that the same word can be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
