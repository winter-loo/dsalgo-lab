# Approach

This problem is similar to "Number of Islands," but instead of counting the number of islands, we need to find the maximum area of any island.

## Strategy
We can use either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore each island and calculate its area. The key idea is to:
1. Iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. When we find a land cell (1), we explore the entire island connected to it, calculate its area, and mark all cells of that island as visited.
3. Keep track of the maximum area found so far.

## Steps for DFS Approach
1. Initialize a variable `max_area` to 0 to keep track of the maximum island area.
2. Iterate through each cell in the grid:
   - If the cell is water (0) or has been visited, skip it.
   - If the cell is land (1) and hasn't been visited:
     - Use DFS to explore the entire island connected to this cell and calculate its area.
     - Mark all cells of the island as visited (by changing 1 to 0 or using a separate visited matrix).
     - Update `max_area` if the current island's area is larger.
3. Return `max_area`.

## Steps for BFS Approach
1. Initialize a variable `max_area` to 0.
2. Iterate through each cell in the grid:
   - If the cell is water (0) or has been visited, skip it.
   - If the cell is land (1) and hasn't been visited:
     - Use BFS to explore the entire island connected to this cell and calculate its area.
     - Mark all cells of the island as visited.
     - Update `max_area` if the current island's area is larger.
3. Return `max_area`.

## Implementation Details
- For DFS, we can use a recursive function that explores all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and returns the area of the island.
- For BFS, we can use a queue to keep track of cells to visit and count the number of cells processed.
- To mark cells as visited, we can either:
  - Modify the original grid by changing 1 to 0 (if allowed).
  - Use a separate visited matrix.
- We need to be careful with the grid boundaries and only explore valid cells.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(M * N) where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid. We visit each cell at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - O(M * N) in the worst case for the recursion stack (DFS) or queue (BFS) if the entire grid is filled with land.
  - O(1) if we modify the original grid to mark visited cells.
  - O(M * N) if we use a separate visited matrix.
