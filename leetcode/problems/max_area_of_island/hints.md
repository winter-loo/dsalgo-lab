# Hints for Max Area of Island

1. This problem is an extension of the "Number of Islands" problem, where instead of counting islands, you need to find the maximum area of any island.

2. An island is a group of connected 1's (land) in the grid. The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

3. Consider using either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore each island and calculate its area.

4. For DFS approach:
   - Use a recursive function to explore all connected land cells and count them.
   - Mark visited cells to avoid counting them again.
   - The four directions to explore are up, down, left, and right (not diagonally).

5. For BFS approach:
   - Use a queue to keep track of cells to visit.
   - Start BFS from each unvisited land cell, count all connected land cells, and mark them as visited.

6. To mark cells as visited, you can either:
   - Modify the original grid by changing 1 to 0 or another value.
   - Use a separate visited matrix.

7. Be careful with the grid boundaries and only explore valid cells.

8. Keep track of the maximum area found so far and update it whenever you find a larger island.
