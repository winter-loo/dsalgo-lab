# Approach: Monotonic Deque

## Intuition
The key insight for this problem is that we need to efficiently find the maximum element in a sliding window as it moves through the array. A naive approach would be to scan each window and find the maximum, but that would be O(n*k), which is inefficient for large inputs.

Instead, we can use a monotonic decreasing deque (double-ended queue) to maintain potential maximum candidates within the current window.

## Algorithm
1. Create a deque to store indices of elements from the input array.
2. Process the array elements one by one:
   - Remove elements from the deque that are outside the current window (indices less than i-k+1).
   - Remove elements from the back of the deque that are smaller than the current element (as they can never be the maximum in future windows).
   - Add the current element's index to the back of the deque.
   - If the window has reached its full size (i >= k-1), add the front element of the deque (which is the maximum in the current window) to the result.

3. The deque will maintain elements in decreasing order, with the maximum at the front.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array
  - Each element is processed exactly once and is added/removed from the deque at most once
  
- Space Complexity: O(k) for the deque, which can contain at most k elements
  - The result array is O(n-k+1) but is not counted in auxiliary space

## Implementation Notes
- Use a VecDeque in Rust for the double-ended queue implementation
- Be careful with the indices when adding elements to the result array
- Handle edge cases like when k=1 or the array has only one element
- Remember that we store indices in the deque, not the actual values, to help with window boundary checks
