# Hints for Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

1. Remember the properties of preorder and inorder traversals:
   - Preorder: root, left subtree, right subtree
   - Inorder: left subtree, root, right subtree

2. The first element in preorder is always the root of the tree.

3. Once you identify the root, you can find its position in the inorder array to determine the size of the left and right subtrees.

4. Use a hashmap to quickly find the position of elements in the inorder array.

5. Consider using indices to track the ranges of the arrays rather than creating new subarrays, which can be more efficient.
