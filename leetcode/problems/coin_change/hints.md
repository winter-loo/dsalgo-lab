# Hints for Coin Change

1. This is a classic dynamic programming problem where you need to find the optimal solution (minimum number of coins) for each subproblem (smaller amounts).

2. Think about how to break down the problem: if you know the minimum number of coins needed for smaller amounts, how can you use that information to solve for larger amounts?

3. For each amount, you have multiple choices - you can use any of the available coin denominations if they don't exceed the current amount.

4. Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where dp[i] represents the minimum number of coins needed to make amount i.

5. The base case is dp[0] = 0, since it takes 0 coins to make amount 0.

6. For each amount from 1 to the target amount, and for each coin denomination, update dp[amount] = min(dp[amount], dp[amount - coin] + 1) if using the current coin leads to a better solution.

7. Be careful with initialization - you should initialize dp[i] to a value larger than any possible answer (e.g., amount + 1) for all i > 0.

8. If dp[amount] is still equal to the initialization value after the algorithm, it means the amount cannot be made with the given coins, so return -1.

9. Consider edge cases: What if the amount is 0? What if there are no coins?
