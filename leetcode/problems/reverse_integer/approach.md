# Approach

The "Reverse Integer" problem asks us to reverse the digits of a signed 32-bit
integer, with the constraint that if the reversed integer overflows (goes
outside the range of a signed 32-bit integer), we should return 0.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to reverse the digits of an integer while preserving its sign. For example:
- 123 becomes 321
- -123 becomes -321
- 120 becomes 21 (note that leading zeros are removed)

The key challenge is handling potential overflow, as the reversed integer might exceed the 32-bit integer range.

## Mathematical Approach

The most straightforward approach is to use mathematical operations to extract each digit and build the reversed number:

1. Initialize the result to 0.
2. While the input number is not 0:
   - Extract the last digit of the input number using the modulo operation: `digit = x % 10`.
   - Check for potential overflow before adding the digit to the result.
   - Add the digit to the result: `result = result * 10 + digit`.
   - Remove the last digit from the input number: `x = x / 10`.
3. Return the result.

## Handling Overflow

To check for potential overflow, we need to ensure that `result * 10 + digit` doesn't exceed the 32-bit integer range. We can do this by checking:
- If `result > INT_MAX / 10`, then multiplying by 10 will definitely cause overflow.
- If `result == INT_MAX / 10` and `digit > INT_MAX % 10`, then adding the digit will cause overflow.

Similar checks are needed for negative numbers.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(log(x)), where x is the input integer. This is because we process each digit of the input number, and the number of digits in an integer is logarithmic in its value.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space.

## Pseudocode

```
function reverse(x):
    result = 0
    
    while x != 0:
        // Extract the last digit
        digit = x % 10
        
        // Check for potential overflow
        if result > INT_MAX / 10 or (result == INT_MAX / 10 and digit > INT_MAX % 10):
            return 0
        if result < INT_MIN / 10 or (result == INT_MIN / 10 and digit < INT_MIN % 10):
            return 0
        
        // Add the digit to the result
        result = result * 10 + digit
        
        // Remove the last digit from x
        x = x / 10
    
    return result
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the algorithm with x = 123:

1. Initialize result = 0.
2. Iteration 1:
   - digit = 123 % 10 = 3
   - No overflow, so result = 0 * 10 + 3 = 3
   - x = 123 / 10 = 12
3. Iteration 2:
   - digit = 12 % 10 = 2
   - No overflow, so result = 3 * 10 + 2 = 32
   - x = 12 / 10 = 1
4. Iteration 3:
   - digit = 1 % 10 = 1
   - No overflow, so result = 32 * 10 + 1 = 321
   - x = 1 / 10 = 0
5. Since x = 0, we return result = 321.

## Alternative Approaches

### String Conversion Approach

Another approach is to convert the integer to a string, reverse the string, and then convert it back to an integer. However, this approach requires additional space and might not be allowed in some environments.

```
function reverse(x):
    // Handle the sign
    sign = 1
    if x < 0:
        sign = -1
        x = -x
    
    // Convert to string, reverse, and convert back to integer
    str_x = toString(x)
    reversed_str = reverse(str_x)
    result = toInteger(reversed_str) * sign
    
    // Check for overflow
    if result < INT_MIN or result > INT_MAX:
        return 0
    
    return result
```

This approach is more readable but less efficient in terms of space complexity.

## Rust-Specific Considerations

In Rust, we can use the `checked_mul` and `checked_add` methods to handle potential overflow gracefully:

```rust
fn reverse(x: i32) -> i32 {
    let mut x = x;
    let mut result = 0;
    
    while x != 0 {
        let digit = x % 10;
        
        // Check for potential overflow
        if let Some(new_result) = result.checked_mul(10).and_then(|r| r.checked_add(digit)) {
            result = new_result;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
        
        x /= 10;
    }
    
    result
}
```

This approach leverages Rust's built-in overflow checking to simplify the code.
