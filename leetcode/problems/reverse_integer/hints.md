# Hints for Reverse Integer

1. Think about how to extract the last digit of a number. You can use the modulo operation: `digit = x % 10`.

2. After extracting the last digit, you can remove it from the number by integer division: `x = x / 10`.

3. To build the reversed number, you can multiply the current result by 10 and add the extracted digit: `result = result * 10 + digit`.

4. Be careful about handling the sign of the number. You can either handle it separately or let the modulo and division operations handle it naturally.

5. The key challenge is detecting overflow. Remember that if the reversed integer doesn't fit in a 32-bit signed integer range, you should return 0.

6. To check for potential overflow before adding a digit, consider if `result > INT_MAX / 10` or if `result == INT_MAX / 10` and `digit > INT_MAX % 10`.

7. Similarly, for negative numbers, check if `result < INT_MIN / 10` or if `result == INT_MIN / 10` and `digit < INT_MIN % 10`.

8. In Rust, you can use the `checked_mul` and `checked_add` methods to handle potential overflow gracefully.

9. Remember that leading zeros in the reversed number should be removed. This happens naturally when building the number digit by digit.

10. The time complexity of your solution should be O(log(x)), where x is the input integer, as you process each digit of the number.
