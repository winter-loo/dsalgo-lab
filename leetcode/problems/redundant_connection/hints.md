# Hints for Redundant Connection

1. This problem asks you to find an edge that can be removed to make the graph a tree. The graph is initially a tree with one extra edge added, which creates a cycle.

2. A tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles. So, the redundant edge is the one that creates a cycle in the graph.

3. There are two main approaches to solve this problem:
   - Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)

4. For the Union-Find approach:
   - Initialize each node as its own set.
   - For each edge (u, v), check if u and v are already in the same set (connected).
   - If they are, then adding this edge would create a cycle, so it's the redundant edge.
   - Otherwise, union the sets containing u and v.

5. For the DFS approach:
   - Build an adjacency list representation of the graph.
   - For each edge (u, v) in reverse order, temporarily remove it and check if u and v are still connected.
   - If they are still connected, then this edge is part of the cycle and can be removed.

6. Remember that if there are multiple answers, you should return the edge that occurs last in the input.

7. Note that the nodes are labeled from 1 to n, but array indices in most programming languages start from 0. Be careful with the indexing.

8. The Union-Find approach is more efficient for this problem, with a time complexity of O(n * α(n)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which is effectively constant for practical purposes.
