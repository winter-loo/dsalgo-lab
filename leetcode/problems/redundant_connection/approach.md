# Approach

This problem asks us to find an edge that can be removed from a graph to make it a tree. The graph is initially a tree with one extra edge added, which creates a cycle. We need to find and return the edge that creates the cycle, and if there are multiple such edges, return the one that appears last in the input.

## Strategy
Since we're dealing with a graph that has exactly one cycle, and we need to find the edge that creates this cycle, we can use either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Union-Find (Disjoint Set) to solve this problem:

1. **DFS Approach**: For each edge, check if removing it would break the cycle. This can be done by temporarily removing the edge and checking if the graph still has a cycle.

2. **Union-Find Approach**: Process the edges one by one. For each edge, check if the two nodes are already in the same set (connected). If they are, then adding this edge would create a cycle, so it's the redundant edge. Otherwise, union the sets containing the two nodes.

## Union-Find Approach
The Union-Find approach is more efficient for this problem:

1. Initialize a Union-Find data structure with n nodes, where each node is in its own set.
2. For each edge (u, v):
   - If u and v are already in the same set (connected), then adding this edge would create a cycle, so it's the redundant edge.
   - Otherwise, union the sets containing u and v.
3. Return the last edge that would create a cycle.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * α(n)) where n is the number of nodes and α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly and is effectively constant for practical purposes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the disjoint set data structure.

## Pseudocode for Union-Find Approach
```
function findRedundantConnection(edges):
    n = edges.length
    
    // Initialize Union-Find data structure
    parent = array of size n+1, where parent[i] = i
    rank = array of size n+1, all 0
    
    // Process each edge
    for each [u, v] in edges:
        rootU = find(u, parent)
        rootV = find(v, parent)
        
        if rootU == rootV:
            // Cycle detected, this is the redundant edge
            return [u, v]
        
        // Union the sets
        union(rootU, rootV, parent, rank)
    
    // This should not happen if the input is valid
    return []

function find(x, parent):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x], parent)
    return parent[x]

function union(x, y, parent, rank):
    rootX = find(x, parent)
    rootY = find(y, parent)
    
    if rootX == rootY:
        return
    
    if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
        parent[rootX] = rootY
    else if rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
        parent[rootY] = rootX
    else:
        parent[rootY] = rootX
        rank[rootX]++
```

## DFS Approach
The DFS approach is less efficient but still works:

1. Build an adjacency list representation of the graph from the edges.
2. For each edge (u, v) in reverse order:
   - Temporarily remove the edge from the graph.
   - Check if u and v are still connected using DFS.
   - If they are not connected, then this edge is a bridge and not part of the cycle.
   - If they are still connected, then this edge is part of the cycle and can be removed.
3. Return the first edge found that can be removed.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n²) because we may need to perform a DFS for each edge, and each DFS takes O(n) time.
