# Approach

The "Counting Bits" problem asks us to count the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number from 0 to n.

## Understanding the Problem

For each integer i from 0 to n, we need to determine the number of 1 bits in its binary representation and store these counts in an array.

## Approaches

### 1. Brute Force Approach

The most straightforward approach is to count the number of 1 bits for each number from 0 to n using the techniques from the "Number of 1 Bits" problem.

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n), as we need to check each bit for each number.
**Space Complexity**: O(n) for the result array.

### 2. Dynamic Programming Approach

We can use dynamic programming to optimize this solution. There are several patterns we can exploit:

#### Pattern 1: Using the Last Set Bit

For any number x, x & (x-1) removes the last set bit. So, the number of 1 bits in x is 1 + the number of 1 bits in x & (x-1).

```
dp[i] = dp[i & (i-1)] + 1
```

#### Pattern 2: Using Powers of 2

For any number x, if we know the number of 1 bits in x/2, we can determine the number of 1 bits in x:
- If x is even, then x and x/2 have the same number of 1 bits.
- If x is odd, then x has one more 1 bit than x/2.

```
dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
```

#### Pattern 3: Using Offset

For any number x, we can express it as x = 2^k + offset, where 2^k is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to x. The number of 1 bits in x is 1 + the number of 1 bits in offset.

```
dp[i] = dp[i - offset] + 1, where offset is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to i
```

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we process each number once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the result array.

## Pseudocode for Pattern 2

```
function countBits(n):
    dp = new array of size n+1, initialized with 0
    
    for i from 1 to n:
        dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
    
    return dp
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the algorithm with the example: n = 5

1. Initialize dp = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
2. For i = 1:
   - dp[1] = dp[1 >> 1] + (1 & 1) = dp[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
3. For i = 2:
   - dp[2] = dp[2 >> 1] + (2 & 1) = dp[1] + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1
4. For i = 3:
   - dp[3] = dp[3 >> 1] + (3 & 1) = dp[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
5. For i = 4:
   - dp[4] = dp[4 >> 1] + (4 & 1) = dp[2] + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1
6. For i = 5:
   - dp[5] = dp[5 >> 1] + (5 & 1) = dp[2] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
7. Return dp = [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2].

## Alternative Approaches

### Using Brian Kernighan's Algorithm

We can also use Brian Kernighan's algorithm to count the number of 1 bits for each number:

```
function countBits(n):
    dp = new array of size n+1, initialized with 0
    
    for i from 1 to n:
        count = 0
        x = i
        while x != 0:
            x = x & (x - 1)
            count++
        dp[i] = count
    
    return dp
```

However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is less efficient than the dynamic programming approaches.
