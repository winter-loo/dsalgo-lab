# Hints for Task Scheduler

1. The key insight is that the task with the highest frequency will determine the minimum time required.

2. Consider how to arrange tasks to minimize idle time. Tasks with higher frequencies should be prioritized.

3. For each occurrence of the most frequent task (except the last one), we need to allocate (n+1) slots (1 for the task itself and n for the cooldown).

4. The minimum number of slots required can be calculated as: (max_freq - 1) * (n + 1) + (count of tasks with max_freq).

5. However, if there are many different types of tasks, we might not need any idle time. The actual answer is the maximum of the calculated value and the total number of tasks.
