# Approach

The "Merge Intervals" problem asks us to merge all overlapping intervals in an array of intervals.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to merge any intervals that overlap. Two intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` overlap if `b >= c` and `a <= d`.

## Sorting-Based Approach

1. Sort the intervals based on their start times.
2. Initialize a result array with the first interval.
3. Iterate through the remaining intervals:
   - If the current interval overlaps with the last interval in the result, merge them.
   - Otherwise, add the current interval to the result.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals. Sorting takes O(n log n) time, and then we do a linear scan through the intervals.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the result array.

## Pseudocode

```
function merge(intervals):
    if intervals is empty:
        return empty list
    
    // Sort intervals by start time
    sort intervals by intervals[i][0]
    
    result = [intervals[0]]
    
    for i from 1 to length(intervals) - 1:
        current = intervals[i]
        last = result[result.length - 1]
        
        // If current interval overlaps with the last interval in result
        if current[0] <= last[1]:
            // Merge the intervals
            last[1] = max(last[1], current[1])
        else:
            // Add the current interval to result
            result.append(current)
    
    return result
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the algorithm with the example: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

1. Sort the intervals (already sorted in this case).
2. Initialize result = [[1,3]].
3. Process [2,6]:
   - [2,6] overlaps with [1,3] (2 <= 3), so merge them.
   - Update result = [[1,6]].
4. Process [8,10]:
   - [8,10] doesn't overlap with [1,6] (8 > 6), so add it to result.
   - Update result = [[1,6], [8,10]].
5. Process [15,18]:
   - [15,18] doesn't overlap with [8,10] (15 > 10), so add it to result.
   - Update result = [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]].
6. Return result = [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]].

## Alternative Approach: Line Sweep

Another approach is to use a line sweep algorithm:
1. Create events for the start and end of each interval.
2. Sort the events by time.
3. Scan through the events, keeping track of the number of open intervals.
4. When the count changes from 0 to 1, start a new interval.
5. When the count changes from 1 to 0, end the current interval.

However, the sorting-based approach is generally simpler and equally efficient for this problem.
