# Approach

This problem asks us to find the minimum cost to connect all points, where the cost between two points is the Manhattan distance. This is essentially a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem in a complete graph, where:
- Each point is a node.
- There is an edge between every pair of points, with the weight being the Manhattan distance.
- We need to find a tree that connects all points with the minimum total edge weight.

## Strategy
We can use standard MST algorithms to solve this problem:
1. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Sort all edges by weight and greedily add edges to the MST if they don't create a cycle.
2. **Prim's Algorithm**: Start with an arbitrary node and greedily add the nearest node to the MST until all nodes are included.

## Kruskal's Algorithm Approach
1. Calculate the Manhattan distance between every pair of points.
2. Sort all edges (pairs of points) by their distances.
3. Use a Union-Find data structure to detect cycles.
4. Greedily add edges to the MST if they don't create a cycle, until all points are connected.

## Time and Space Complexity for Kruskal's Algorithm
- **Time Complexity**: O(n² log n) where n is the number of points. We have O(n²) edges, and sorting them takes O(n² log n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n²) for storing all edges.

## Pseudocode for Kruskal's Algorithm
```
function minCostConnectPoints(points):
    n = points.length
    edges = []
    
    // Calculate all edges
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        for j from i+1 to n-1:
            distance = |points[i][0] - points[j][0]| + |points[i][1] - points[j][1]|
            edges.push([i, j, distance])
    
    // Sort edges by distance
    sort edges by distance
    
    // Union-Find data structure
    parent = array of size n, initialized with parent[i] = i
    rank = array of size n, initialized with 0
    
    // Kruskal's algorithm
    mst_cost = 0
    edge_count = 0
    
    for each [u, v, distance] in edges:
        if find(u) != find(v):
            union(u, v)
            mst_cost += distance
            edge_count += 1
            
            if edge_count == n-1:
                break
    
    return mst_cost
    
function find(x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x])
    return parent[x]
    
function union(x, y):
    root_x = find(x)
    root_y = find(y)
    
    if root_x == root_y:
        return
    
    if rank[root_x] < rank[root_y]:
        parent[root_x] = root_y
    else if rank[root_x] > rank[root_y]:
        parent[root_y] = root_x
    else:
        parent[root_y] = root_x
        rank[root_x] += 1
```

## Prim's Algorithm Approach
1. Start with an arbitrary point (e.g., the first point).
2. Maintain a priority queue of edges connecting the MST to the remaining points.
3. Greedily add the nearest point to the MST until all points are included.

## Time and Space Complexity for Prim's Algorithm
- **Time Complexity**: O(n² log n) where n is the number of points. For each of the n points, we may need to update the priority queue with O(n) edges, each taking O(log n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the priority queue and the MST.

## Pseudocode for Prim's Algorithm
```
function minCostConnectPoints(points):
    n = points.length
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    
    // Adjacency list
    graph = empty map from int to list of [neighbor, distance]
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        for j from i+1 to n-1:
            distance = |points[i][0] - points[j][0]| + |points[i][1] - points[j][1]|
            graph[i].push([j, distance])
            graph[j].push([i, distance])
    
    // Prim's algorithm
    mst_cost = 0
    visited = set containing 0
    pq = priority queue containing all edges from node 0, sorted by distance
    
    while visited.size < n:
        [node, distance] = pq.poll()
        
        if node in visited:
            continue
        
        visited.add(node)
        mst_cost += distance
        
        for each [neighbor, neighbor_distance] in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                pq.push([neighbor, neighbor_distance])
    
    return mst_cost
```

## Optimized Prim's Algorithm
We can optimize Prim's algorithm by avoiding the explicit construction of the graph:
1. Start with the first point.
2. Maintain an array `min_dist` where `min_dist[i]` is the minimum distance from point `i` to any point in the MST.
3. In each iteration, add the point with the minimum distance to the MST and update the `min_dist` array.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n²) and a space complexity of O(n), which is more efficient than the standard Prim's algorithm for dense graphs like this one.
