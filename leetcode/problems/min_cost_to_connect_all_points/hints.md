# Hints for Min Cost to Connect All Points

1. This problem is asking for the minimum cost to connect all points, where the cost between two points is the Manhattan distance. This is essentially a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem.

2. The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

3. There are two standard algorithms for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree:
   - Kruskal's Algorithm
   - Prim's Algorithm

4. For Kruskal's Algorithm:
   - Calculate the Manhattan distance between every pair of points.
   - Sort all edges (pairs of points) by their distances.
   - Use a Union-Find data structure to detect cycles.
   - Greedily add edges to the MST if they don't create a cycle, until all points are connected.

5. For Prim's Algorithm:
   - Start with an arbitrary point (e.g., the first point).
   - Maintain a priority queue of edges connecting the MST to the remaining points.
   - Greedily add the nearest point to the MST until all points are included.

6. The Union-Find data structure is crucial for Kruskal's Algorithm to efficiently detect cycles.

7. For dense graphs like this one (where every point is connected to every other point), Prim's Algorithm can be optimized to run in O(n²) time, which is more efficient than Kruskal's Algorithm's O(n² log n) time.

8. Remember that a Minimum Spanning Tree for n points will have exactly n-1 edges.

9. The problem guarantees that all pairs of coordinates are distinct, so you don't need to handle duplicate points.

10. Consider the edge case where there is only one point. In this case, the minimum cost is 0 since no connections are needed.
