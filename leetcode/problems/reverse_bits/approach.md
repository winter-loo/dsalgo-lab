# Approach

The "Reverse Bits" problem asks us to reverse the bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to reverse the order of the bits in a 32-bit unsigned integer. For example, if the input is `00000010100101000001111010011100`, the output should be `00111001011110000010100101000000`.

## Bit Manipulation Approaches

### 1. Bit-by-Bit Approach

1. Initialize the result to 0.
2. Iterate through the 32 bits of the input number.
3. For each bit:
   - Shift the result left by 1 to make room for the next bit.
   - Extract the least significant bit (LSB) of the input number.
   - Add the extracted bit to the result.
   - Shift the input number right by 1 to process the next bit.
4. Return the result.

### 2. Divide and Conquer Approach

This approach involves swapping bits in a divide-and-conquer manner:
1. Swap all adjacent bits (bits 0 and 1, bits 2 and 3, etc.).
2. Swap all adjacent pairs of bits (bits 0-1 and 2-3, bits 4-5 and 6-7, etc.).
3. Swap all adjacent 4 bits (bits 0-3 and 4-7, bits 8-11 and 12-15, etc.).
4. Swap all adjacent 8 bits (bits 0-7 and 8-15, bits 16-23 and 24-31).
5. Swap all adjacent 16 bits (bits 0-15 and 16-31).

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for both approaches, as we're dealing with a fixed-size integer (32 bits).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for both approaches, as we only use a single variable to store the result.

## Pseudocode for Bit-by-Bit Approach

```
function reverseBits(n):
    result = 0
    
    for i from 0 to 31:
        // Shift result left by 1 to make room for the next bit
        result = result << 1
        
        // Extract the least significant bit of n
        bit = n & 1
        
        // Add the extracted bit to the result
        result = result | bit
        
        // Shift n right by 1 to process the next bit
        n = n >> 1
    
    return result
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the bit-by-bit approach with a simplified example: n = 43 (binary 00000000000000000000000000101011)

1. Initialize result = 0.
2. Iterate through the 32 bits:
   - i = 0: result = 0 << 1 = 0, bit = 1, result = 0 | 1 = 1, n = 21
   - i = 1: result = 1 << 1 = 2, bit = 1, result = 2 | 1 = 3, n = 10
   - i = 2: result = 3 << 1 = 6, bit = 0, result = 6 | 0 = 6, n = 5
   - i = 3: result = 6 << 1 = 12, bit = 1, result = 12 | 1 = 13, n = 2
   - i = 4: result = 13 << 1 = 26, bit = 0, result = 26 | 0 = 26, n = 1
   - i = 5: result = 26 << 1 = 52, bit = 1, result = 52 | 1 = 53, n = 0
   - i = 6 to 31: n = 0, so bit = 0, and result is shifted left with no new bits added.
3. Return result = 3489660928 (binary 11010110000000000000000000000000).

## Optimization for Multiple Calls

If this function is called many times, we can use a cache to store the results of previous calculations. Since there are only 2^32 possible inputs, we can't cache all of them, but we can cache the results for smaller chunks (e.g., 8 bits) and combine them.

For example, we can precompute the reverse of all 8-bit numbers (0 to 255) and use these to reverse a 32-bit number in 4 operations:

```
function reverseBits(n):
    // Precomputed table for reversing 8-bit numbers
    table = precomputeReverseBitsTable()
    
    // Extract and reverse each 8-bit chunk
    result = table[n & 0xff] << 24
    result |= table[(n >> 8) & 0xff] << 16
    result |= table[(n >> 16) & 0xff] << 8
    result |= table[(n >> 24) & 0xff]
    
    return result
```

This approach reduces the number of operations from 32 to 4, which can be significant if the function is called many times.
