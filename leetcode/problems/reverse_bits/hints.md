# Hints for Reverse Bits

1. Think about how to extract each bit from the input number and place it in the reversed position.

2. Remember that you need to reverse all 32 bits, even if the most significant bits are 0.

3. You can extract the least significant bit (LSB) of a number using the bitwise AND operation with 1: `n & 1`.

4. After extracting a bit, you can shift the input number right by 1 to process the next bit: `n >>= 1`.

5. To build the reversed number, start with 0 and for each bit:
   - Shift the result left by 1 to make room for the next bit.
   - Add the extracted bit to the result using the bitwise OR operation.

6. Alternatively, you can use a divide-and-conquer approach by swapping bits in groups:
   - First swap all adjacent bits.
   - Then swap all adjacent pairs of bits.
   - Continue doubling the group size until you've swapped the entire 32-bit number.

7. If this function is called many times, consider using a lookup table for smaller chunks (e.g., 8 bits) to improve performance.

8. Be careful with the bit shifting operations, especially in languages where the shift operators behave differently for signed and unsigned integers.

9. Remember that the problem is asking for a bit reversal, not a numerical reversal. For example, the reverse of 43 (101011) is not 53 (110101), but rather the 32-bit number with the bits of 43 in reverse order.

10. The time complexity of your solution should be O(1) since we're dealing with a fixed-size integer (32 bits).
