# Approach

This problem asks us to determine if a given undirected graph is a valid tree. For a graph to be a valid tree, it must satisfy two conditions:
1. The graph must be fully connected (all nodes can be reached from any starting node).
2. The graph must not contain any cycles.

## Strategy
We can use either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to solve this problem:

1. **Check Edge Count**: A tree with n nodes must have exactly n-1 edges. If the number of edges is not n-1, we can immediately return false.
2. **Check Connectivity and Cycles**: Use DFS or BFS to traverse the graph and check if:
   - All nodes are reachable from a single source (the graph is connected).
   - There are no cycles in the graph.

## DFS Approach
1. Build an adjacency list representation of the graph from the edges.
2. Use a visited array to keep track of nodes visited during the DFS traversal.
3. Perform a DFS from node 0 and check for cycles by keeping track of the parent node.
4. After the DFS, check if all nodes have been visited (the graph is connected).

## BFS Approach
1. Build an adjacency list representation of the graph from the edges.
2. Use a visited array to keep track of nodes visited during the BFS traversal.
3. Perform a BFS from node 0 and check for cycles by keeping track of the parent node.
4. After the BFS, check if all nodes have been visited (the graph is connected).

## Union-Find Approach
1. Initialize a Union-Find data structure with n nodes.
2. For each edge (u, v):
   - If u and v are already in the same set (connected), then adding this edge would create a cycle, so return false.
   - Otherwise, union the sets containing u and v.
3. After processing all edges, check if all nodes are in the same set (the graph is connected).

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges. We need to visit each node and each edge once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for storing the adjacency list and the visited array.

## Pseudocode for DFS Approach
```
function validTree(n, edges):
    // Check edge count
    if edges.length != n - 1:
        return false
    
    // Build adjacency list
    graph = empty adjacency list of size n
    for each [u, v] in edges:
        add v to graph[u]
        add u to graph[v]
    
    // Array to track visited nodes
    visited = array of size n, all false
    
    // Check for cycles and connectivity
    if hasCycle(0, -1, graph, visited):
        return false
    
    // Check if all nodes are visited (graph is connected)
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        if not visited[i]:
            return false
    
    return true

function hasCycle(node, parent, graph, visited):
    visited[node] = true
    
    for each neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            if visited[neighbor]:
                // Cycle detected
                return true
            if hasCycle(neighbor, node, graph, visited):
                return true
    
    return false
```

## Pseudocode for Union-Find Approach
```
function validTree(n, edges):
    // Check edge count
    if edges.length != n - 1:
        return false
    
    // Initialize Union-Find data structure
    parent = array of size n, where parent[i] = i
    rank = array of size n, all 0
    
    // Process each edge
    for each [u, v] in edges:
        rootU = find(u, parent)
        rootV = find(v, parent)
        
        if rootU == rootV:
            // Cycle detected
            return false
        
        // Union the sets
        union(rootU, rootV, parent, rank)
    
    // If we reach here, the graph is a valid tree
    return true

function find(x, parent):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x], parent)
    return parent[x]

function union(x, y, parent, rank):
    rootX = find(x, parent)
    rootY = find(y, parent)
    
    if rootX == rootY:
        return
    
    if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
        parent[rootX] = rootY
    else if rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
        parent[rootY] = rootX
    else:
        parent[rootY] = rootX
        rank[rootX]++
```
