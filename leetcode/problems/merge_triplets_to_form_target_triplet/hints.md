# Hints for Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet

1. Remember that when merging triplets, each element in the resulting
triplet is the maximum of the corresponding elements in the original
triplets.

2. Once a value in a triplet exceeds the target value at the same
position, that triplet cannot be used to form the target.

3. Focus on identifying which triplets are "good" - those that don't
have any element exceeding the target.

4. For each position in the target triplet, you need at least one "good"
triplet that has the exact value at that position.

5. Think about what happens when you merge multiple triplets - you can
achieve the maximum value for each position independently.

6. If you can find a "good" triplet with the target value in the first
position, another with the target value in the second position, and
another with the target value in the third position, you can merge them
to get the target.

7. You don't need to actually perform the merging operations - just
check if it's theoretically possible.

8. Consider using a greedy approach: filter out "bad" triplets and check
if the remaining ones can form the target.

9. Be careful with edge cases, such as when there are no "good" triplets
or when the target has the same value for different positions.

10. Remember that you can apply the merging operation any number of times,
including zero times.
