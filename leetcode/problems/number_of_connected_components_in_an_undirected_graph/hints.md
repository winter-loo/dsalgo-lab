# Hints for Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

1. This problem asks you to count the number of connected components in an undirected graph. A connected component is a subgraph where any two vertices are connected by a path.

2. There are multiple approaches to solve this problem:
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

3. For the DFS/BFS approach:
   - Build an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Use a visited array to keep track of nodes you've already processed.
   - For each unvisited node, perform a DFS/BFS to visit all nodes in its connected component.
   - Each time you start a new DFS/BFS (because you found an unvisited node), you've found a new connected component.

4. For the Union-Find approach:
   - Initialize each node as its own set.
   - For each edge (u, v), union the sets containing u and v.
   - After processing all edges, count the number of distinct sets (roots).

5. Remember that the graph is undirected, so when building your adjacency list, add edges in both directions.

6. Consider edge cases:
   - What if there are no edges (all nodes are isolated)?
   - What if all nodes are connected (one large component)?

7. The time complexity for both approaches is O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.

8. The Union-Find approach can be optimized with path compression and union by rank to achieve near-constant time operations.
