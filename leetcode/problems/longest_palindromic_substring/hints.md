# Hints for Longest Palindromic Substring

1. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, "aba", "racecar", and "level" are palindromes.

2. There are multiple approaches to solve this problem. Consider which one might be most efficient for your implementation.

3. The brute force approach would be to check every possible substring, but this is very inefficient (O(nÂ³) time complexity).

4. Think about how you can use the property of palindromes to optimize your solution.

5. One efficient approach is to expand around potential centers of palindromes. For each position in the string, try to expand outwards to find the longest palindrome.

6. Remember to consider both odd-length palindromes (with a single character at the center) and even-length palindromes (with two characters at the center).

7. Dynamic programming can also be used: define `dp[i][j]` to be true if the substring from i to j is a palindrome.

8. For the DP approach, the recurrence relation is: `dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) && dp[i+1][j-1]`

9. Be careful with edge cases, such as empty strings or strings with only one character.
