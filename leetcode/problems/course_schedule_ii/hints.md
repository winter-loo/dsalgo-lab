# Hints for Course Schedule II

1. This problem is an extension of the Course Schedule problem. It not only asks if a valid course ordering exists, but also requires you to return that ordering.

2. The problem is essentially asking for a topological sort of a directed graph. If a cycle exists, it will be impossible to finish all courses.

3. Think about how to represent the relationships between courses as a graph. Each course can be a node, and each prerequisite relationship can be a directed edge.

4. There are two main approaches to solve this problem:
   - Depth-First Search (DFS) with cycle detection
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS) using Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting

5. For the DFS approach:
   - Keep track of nodes being visited in the current DFS traversal
   - Add nodes to the result in post-order (after all descendants are processed)
   - Reverse the result to get the correct topological order
   - If a cycle is detected, return an empty array

6. For the BFS approach (Kahn's algorithm):
   - Calculate the in-degree (number of prerequisites) for each course
   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree = 0)
   - As you "take" each course, add it to the result and reduce the in-degree of courses that depend on it
   - If you can process all courses this way, return the result; otherwise, return an empty array

7. Remember that the input format is different from a typical graph representation. You'll need to convert the prerequisites array into an adjacency list or matrix.

8. Be careful with the direction of edges in your graph. If [a, b] means "a depends on b", then the edge should go from b to a in your graph, not from a to b.

9. Consider edge cases: What if there are no prerequisites at all? What if there's only one course?
