# Hints for K Closest Points to Origin

1. The distance from a point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0) is sqrt(x² + y²).

2. For comparison purposes, you can use the squared distance (x² + y²) instead of the actual Euclidean distance to avoid the square root calculation.

3. Consider these different approaches:
   - Sort all points by their distances and return the first k points (O(n log n)).
   - Use a max-heap of size k to keep track of the k closest points (O(n log k)).
   - Use the QuickSelect algorithm to find the k closest points (O(n) average time).

4. In Rust, you can use the `BinaryHeap` collection with a custom comparator to implement the max-heap approach.

5. Remember that the answer can be returned in any order, as long as it contains the k closest points.
