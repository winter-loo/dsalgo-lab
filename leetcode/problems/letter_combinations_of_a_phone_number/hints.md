# Hints for Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

1. First, create a mapping of digits to their corresponding letters according to the telephone keypad:
   - 2: "abc"
   - 3: "def"
   - 4: "ghi"
   - 5: "jkl"
   - 6: "mno"
   - 7: "pqrs"
   - 8: "tuv"
   - 9: "wxyz"

2. This problem can be solved using either backtracking or an iterative approach.

3. For the backtracking approach:
   - Use a recursive function to build combinations one character at a time.
   - For each digit, try all possible letters and recursively build the rest of the combination.
   - When you've processed all digits, add the current combination to the result.

4. For the iterative approach:
   - Start with an empty result list (or a list containing an empty string).
   - For each digit, create new combinations by appending each possible letter to each existing combination.

5. Handle the edge case where the input string is empty (return an empty list).

6. Remember that the constraints mention the input length is at most 4, so the number of combinations is manageable.
