# Approach

To find all possible letter combinations of a phone number, we need to generate all combinations of letters corresponding to each digit in the input string.

## Strategy
This problem can be solved using either backtracking or iterative approaches:

1. **Backtracking**: Recursively build combinations by exploring all possible letters for each digit.
2. **Iterative**: Build combinations incrementally by processing one digit at a time.

## Steps for Backtracking Approach
1. Create a mapping of digits to their corresponding letters.
2. Use a recursive backtracking function to explore all combinations:
   - If we've processed all digits, add the current combination to the result.
   - Otherwise, for each letter corresponding to the current digit, add it to the current combination and recursively explore the next digit.
   - After the recursive call, remove the last letter (backtrack) to try other letters.

## Steps for Iterative Approach
1. Create a mapping of digits to their corresponding letters.
2. Start with an empty result list (or a list containing an empty string if the input is not empty).
3. For each digit in the input:
   - Create a new list to store the updated combinations.
   - For each existing combination in the result, append each letter corresponding to the current digit to create new combinations.
   - Replace the result with these new combinations.

## Implementation Details
- The mapping of digits to letters can be implemented using a hash map or an array.
- For the backtracking approach, we need to keep track of the current combination and the index of the current digit.
- For the iterative approach, we need to update the result list for each digit.

## Pseudocode for Backtracking Approach
```
function letterCombinations(digits):
    if digits is empty:
        return []
    
    mapping = {
        '2': "abc", '3': "def", '4': "ghi", '5': "jkl",
        '6': "mno", '7': "pqrs", '8': "tuv", '9': "wxyz"
    }
    
    result = []
    backtrack(digits, 0, "", result, mapping)
    return result

function backtrack(digits, index, current, result, mapping):
    if index == digits.length:
        add current to result
        return
    
    for each letter in mapping[digits[index]]:
        append letter to current
        backtrack(digits, index + 1, current, result, mapping)
        remove the last letter from current (backtrack)
```

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(4^N * N) where N is the length of the input string. In the worst case (if all digits map to 4 letters), there are 4^N combinations, and it takes O(N) time to build each combination.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for the recursion stack in the backtracking approach, plus O(4^N * N) to store all combinations in the worst case.
