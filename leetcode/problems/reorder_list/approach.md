# Approach: Reorder List

## Intuition
The key insight for this problem is to find an efficient way to interleave the first half of the list with the reversed second half. This can be broken down into three main steps: finding the middle of the list, reversing the second half, and then merging the two halves.

## Multiple Approaches

### Approach 1: Three-Step Process
1. **Find the middle of the linked list** using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. **Reverse the second half** of the linked list.
3. **Merge the two halves** by interleaving nodes from the first half and the reversed second half.

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the list a constant number of times.
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space.

### Approach 2: Using a Stack
1. Traverse the linked list and push all nodes onto a stack.
2. Traverse the list again up to the middle, and for each node, pop a node from the stack and insert it after the current node.
3. Set the next pointer of the last node to null to terminate the list.

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the list twice.
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - We use a stack to store all nodes.

### Approach 3: Using an Array
1. Traverse the linked list and store all nodes in an array.
2. Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and one from the end of the array, to reorder the list.

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the list once to build the array and once to reorder.
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - We use an array to store all nodes.

## Implementation Notes
- The three-step process is the most space-efficient approach, as it uses only O(1) extra space.
- When finding the middle of the list, be careful with the handling of even-length lists. The "middle" should be the end of the first half.
- When reversing the second half, make sure to properly update the next pointers to avoid creating cycles.
- When merging the two halves, be careful with the termination condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Edge cases to consider:
  - Empty list
  - List with only one node
  - List with only two nodes
  - List with an odd number of nodes
  - List with an even number of nodes
