# Hints for Network Delay Time

1. This problem is asking for the minimum time it takes for a signal to reach all nodes in a network, starting from a given node. This is essentially a shortest path problem in a weighted directed graph.

2. The key insight is that the time it takes for all nodes to receive the signal is the maximum of the shortest paths from the source node to all other nodes.

3. There are several algorithms you can use to solve this problem:
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm
   - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
   - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

4. Dijkstra's algorithm is the most efficient choice for this problem since we only need to find the shortest paths from a single source node and all edge weights are non-negative.

5. To implement Dijkstra's algorithm:
   - Build an adjacency list representation of the graph.
   - Initialize a distance array with infinity for all nodes except the source node, which is set to 0.
   - Use a priority queue to process nodes in order of their current distance from the source.
   - For each node, update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.

6. After finding the shortest paths, check if all nodes are reachable from the source (no infinite distances). If any node is unreachable, return -1.

7. If all nodes are reachable, return the maximum distance, which represents the time when the last node receives the signal.

8. Remember that the nodes are labeled from 1 to n, but array indices in most programming languages start from 0. Be careful with the indexing.

9. Consider using a min-heap (priority queue) for an efficient implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.

10. The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue is O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes.
