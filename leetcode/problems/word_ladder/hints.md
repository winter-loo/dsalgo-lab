# Hints for Word Ladder

1. This problem asks you to find the shortest transformation sequence from one word to another, where each transformation changes exactly one letter and must result in a word from the given word list.

2. Think of this problem as finding the shortest path in a graph, where:
   - Each word is a node.
   - Two words are connected by an edge if they differ by exactly one letter.

3. Since we're looking for the shortest path, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the ideal algorithm to use.

4. Before starting the search, check if the `endWord` is in the `wordList`. If not, return 0 immediately.

5. For efficient lookups, convert the `wordList` to a set data structure.

6. During the BFS, for each word, try changing each character to every possible letter (a-z) and check if the resulting word is in the word set.

7. To avoid cycles, remove words from the set once they've been visited.

8. Keep track of the level (or distance) during the BFS to know how many transformations have been made.

9. For optimization, consider using bidirectional BFS, which starts the search from both the `beginWord` and the `endWord` simultaneously.

10. Remember that the `beginWord` does not need to be in the `wordList`, but the `endWord` must be.

11. The time complexity of the BFS approach is O(N * M^2), where N is the number of words in the word list and M is the length of each word.
