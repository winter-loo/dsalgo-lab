# Approach

This problem asks us to find the shortest transformation sequence from a beginning word to an ending word, where each transformation changes exactly one letter and must result in a word from the given word list.

## Strategy
This problem can be modeled as a shortest path problem in a graph, where:
- Each word is a node.
- Two words are connected by an edge if they differ by exactly one letter.

Since we're looking for the shortest path, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the ideal algorithm to use.

## BFS Approach
1. Check if the `endWord` is in the `wordList`. If not, return 0.
2. Create a set from the `wordList` for O(1) lookups.
3. Initialize a queue with the `beginWord` and a level (or distance) of 1.
4. While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue a word and its level.
   - For each position in the word, try replacing the character with every letter from 'a' to 'z'.
   - If the new word is in the word set, add it to the queue with level + 1 and remove it from the set to avoid cycles.
   - If the new word is the `endWord`, return the level + 1.
5. If the BFS completes without finding the `endWord`, return 0.

## Bidirectional BFS Approach (Optimization)
To optimize the search, we can use bidirectional BFS, which starts the search from both the `beginWord` and the `endWord` simultaneously:

1. Initialize two queues, one starting from the `beginWord` and one from the `endWord`.
2. Initialize two sets to keep track of visited words from each direction.
3. Perform BFS from both directions, alternating between them.
4. If a word is found in the other direction's visited set, we've found a path.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * M^2) where N is the number of words in the word list and M is the length of each word. For each word, we check M positions, and for each position, we try 26 letters, and checking if a new word is in the set takes O(M) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the word set and the queue.

## Pseudocode for BFS Approach
```
function ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList):
    // Check if endWord is in wordList
    if endWord is not in wordList:
        return 0
    
    // Create a set from wordList for O(1) lookups
    wordSet = set of wordList
    
    // Initialize queue with beginWord and level 1
    queue = empty queue
    queue.enqueue([beginWord, 1])
    
    // BFS
    while queue is not empty:
        [currentWord, level] = queue.dequeue()
        
        // Try changing each character of the word
        for i from 0 to currentWord.length - 1:
            // Try each letter from 'a' to 'z'
            for c in 'a' to 'z':
                // Create a new word with the character at position i replaced by c
                newWord = currentWord with character at position i replaced by c
                
                // If the new word is the endWord, return level + 1
                if newWord == endWord:
                    return level + 1
                
                // If the new word is in the word set
                if newWord is in wordSet:
                    queue.enqueue([newWord, level + 1])
                    wordSet.remove(newWord)  // Remove to avoid cycles
    
    // If no path is found
    return 0
```
