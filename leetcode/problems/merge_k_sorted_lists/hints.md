# Hints for Merge k Sorted Lists

## Key Questions

*   How can you efficiently find the *smallest* node among the current heads of all `k` lists?
*   Once you find the smallest node, how do you advance the corresponding list and repeat the process?
*   What data structure could help you efficiently manage the current heads of the lists and quickly find the minimum?
*   Consider the time complexity of iterating through all `k` list heads repeatedly versus using a more optimized structure.

## Additional Hints

*   **Approach 1: Brute Force / Iteration:** You could iterate through all `k` lists in each step, find the node with the minimum value, add it to the result list, and advance the pointer of the list it came from. What is the time complexity of this approach?

*   **Approach 2: Min-Heap (Priority Queue):**
    *   A min-heap is excellent for maintaining a collection of items and efficiently retrieving the minimum element (O(log k) time, where k is the number of elements in the heap).
    *   What should you store in the min-heap? Storing just the values isn't enough; you need to know which list the value came from to advance its pointer.
    *   Consider storing tuples or custom structs in the min-heap, like `(value, list_index, node_pointer)`. Note: When comparing nodes in the heap, only the `value` should matter.
    *   Initialize the heap with the head node from each non-empty list.
    *   Repeatedly extract the minimum node from the heap, add it to the result list, and if the extracted node has a `next` node in its original list, insert that `next` node into the heap.
    *   What is the time complexity using a min-heap? Consider the total number of nodes `N` across all lists.

*   **Approach 3: Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort Style):**
    *   You know how to merge two sorted lists (Problem 21). Can you adapt this?
    *   Pair up the `k` lists and merge each pair. This reduces the number of lists by half.
    *   Repeat the pairing and merging process until only one list remains.
    *   Think about the structure of Merge Sort. How many merge operations are performed, and what is the cost of each merge? What's the overall time complexity?

*   **Edge Cases:** Consider empty `lists` array, lists containing empty lists, and lists with only one node.
