# Hints for House Robber II

1. This problem is an extension of the original House Robber problem, with the added constraint that the houses are arranged in a circle.

2. The key insight is that in a circular arrangement, if you rob the first house, you cannot rob the last house, and vice versa.

3. Try breaking down the problem into two subproblems:
   - Rob houses from 0 to n-2 (excluding the last house)
   - Rob houses from 1 to n-1 (excluding the first house)

4. Solve each subproblem using the same approach as the original House Robber problem.

5. The final answer will be the maximum of the two subproblems.

6. Be careful with edge cases, especially when there are only one or two houses.

7. Remember that the original House Robber solution can be reused as a helper function for this problem.

8. Think about how to handle the case where the optimal solution might involve robbing neither the first nor the last house.
