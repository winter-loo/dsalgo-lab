# Hints for Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

1. This problem asks you to find the cheapest flight path from a source city to a destination city with at most k stops. This is a shortest path problem with an additional constraint on the number of intermediate stops.

2. Think of the cities as nodes in a graph, and the flights as directed edges with weights (prices).

3. Remember that k stops means k intermediate cities, which translates to at most k+1 flights.

4. Consider using one of these algorithms:
   - Bellman-Ford Algorithm (modified to handle the k stops constraint)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS) with pruning
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm (modified to track stops)

5. For the Bellman-Ford approach:
   - Initialize a distance array where dist[i] represents the minimum cost to reach city i from the source.
   - Relax all edges k+1 times (since we can have at most k stops, which means k+1 edges).
   - Be careful not to use updated values within the same iteration, as this could lead to paths with more than k+1 edges.

6. For the BFS approach:
   - Use a queue to keep track of (city, cost, stops) tuples.
   - Prune paths that exceed k stops or have a higher cost than a previously found path to the same city with the same or fewer stops.

7. For Dijkstra's Algorithm:
   - Use a priority queue to keep track of (cost, city, stops) tuples, sorted by cost.
   - The standard Dijkstra's algorithm might not work directly because the shortest path in terms of cost might exceed the k stops constraint.
   - Modify it to consider both cost and the number of stops.

8. Be careful with the edge case where there is no valid path from the source to the destination with at most k stops.

9. The problem states that there will not be any multiple flights between two cities, which simplifies the graph representation.

10. The source and destination cities are guaranteed to be different, so you don't need to handle the case where src == dst.
