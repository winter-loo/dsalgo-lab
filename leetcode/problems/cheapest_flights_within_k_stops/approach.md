# Approach

This problem asks us to find the cheapest flight path from a source city to a destination city with at most k stops. This is a shortest path problem with an additional constraint on the number of intermediate stops.

## Strategy
We can use several algorithms to solve this problem:

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm (with modifications)**: Find the shortest path from the source to the destination, but keep track of the number of stops.
2. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Find the shortest path from the source to all other nodes, with at most k+1 edges.
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explore all possible paths with at most k stops and keep track of the minimum cost.

## Bellman-Ford Approach
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is well-suited for this problem because it naturally handles the constraint on the number of edges (stops).

1. Initialize an array `dist` of size n, where `dist[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach city i from the source.
2. Initialize `dist[src] = 0` and all other `dist[i] = infinity`.
3. Relax all edges k+1 times (since we can have at most k stops, which means k+1 edges).
4. After relaxation, `dist[dst]` will contain the minimum cost to reach the destination from the source with at most k stops.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(k * E) where E is the number of flights. We relax all edges k+1 times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the distance array.

## Pseudocode for Bellman-Ford Approach
```
function findCheapestPrice(n, flights, src, dst, k):
    // Initialize distance array
    dist = array of size n, all infinity
    dist[src] = 0
    
    // Relax all edges k+1 times
    for i from 0 to k:
        // Create a copy of dist to avoid using updated values in the same iteration
        temp = copy of dist
        
        for each [from, to, price] in flights:
            if dist[from] != infinity:
                temp[to] = min(temp[to], dist[from] + price)
        
        dist = temp
    
    // Return the minimum cost to reach the destination
    if dist[dst] == infinity:
        return -1
    else:
        return dist[dst]
```

## BFS Approach
We can also use a modified BFS to solve this problem:

1. Use a queue to keep track of (city, cost, stops) tuples.
2. Start with (src, 0, 0) in the queue.
3. For each tuple (city, cost, stops) in the queue:
   - If city == dst, update the minimum cost if necessary.
   - If stops > k, skip this path.
   - Otherwise, explore all neighboring cities and add them to the queue.
4. Return the minimum cost found, or -1 if no valid path exists.

## Time and Space Complexity for BFS
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^(k+1)) in the worst case, but with pruning, it can be much better in practice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^(k+1)) for the queue.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm Approach
We can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to handle the constraint on the number of stops:

1. Use a priority queue to keep track of (cost, city, stops) tuples, sorted by cost.
2. Start with (0, src, 0) in the priority queue.
3. For each tuple (cost, city, stops) in the priority queue:
   - If city == dst, return the cost.
   - If stops > k, skip this path.
   - Otherwise, explore all neighboring cities and add them to the priority queue.
4. If the priority queue becomes empty, return -1.

## Time and Space Complexity for Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Time Complexity**: O(E log V) where E is the number of flights and V is the number of cities.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the priority queue.

## Edge Cases and Considerations
- If there is no path from the source to the destination with at most k stops, return -1.
- The problem states that there will not be any multiple flights between two cities, which simplifies the graph representation.
- The source and destination cities are guaranteed to be different.
- The number of stops refers to intermediate cities, not the total number of flights. For example, if we go from city A to city B to city C, that's 1 stop (city B).
