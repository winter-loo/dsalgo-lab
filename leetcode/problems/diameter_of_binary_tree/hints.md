# Hints for Diameter of Binary Tree

1. The diameter may or may not pass through the root node.
2. The diameter at a given node is the sum of the depths of its left and right subtrees.
3. Try using a recursive function that returns the depth of a subtree and updates the maximum diameter as a side effect.
4. Remember that the depth of a node is the number of edges from that node to a leaf.
