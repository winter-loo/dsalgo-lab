# Approach

To clone a graph, we need to create a deep copy of all nodes and their connections, ensuring that the structure of the original graph is preserved.

## Strategy
We can use either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the original graph and create a clone. The key challenge is to handle cycles in the graph, which requires keeping track of nodes that have already been cloned.

## Steps for DFS Approach
1. Use a HashMap to keep track of nodes that have already been cloned, mapping original nodes to their clones.
2. Implement a recursive DFS function that:
   - Takes an original node as input.
   - If the node is null, return null.
   - If the node has already been cloned (exists in the HashMap), return the cloned node.
   - Otherwise, create a new clone of the node and add it to the HashMap.
   - Recursively clone all neighbors of the original node and add them to the clone's neighbors list.
   - Return the cloned node.
3. Start the DFS from the given node.

## Steps for BFS Approach
1. Use a HashMap to keep track of nodes that have already been cloned, mapping original nodes to their clones.
2. Use a queue to keep track of nodes to process.
3. Start by creating a clone of the given node, adding it to the HashMap, and enqueueing the original node.
4. While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue a node from the queue.
   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:
     - If the neighbor has not been cloned yet, create a clone, add it to the HashMap, and enqueue the neighbor.
     - Add the clone of the neighbor to the clone of the current node's neighbors list.
5. Return the clone of the given node.

## Implementation Details
- In Rust, we can use `Rc<RefCell<Node>>` to represent nodes, which allows for shared ownership and interior mutability.
- We need to use a HashMap to keep track of nodes that have already been cloned, mapping original nodes to their clones.
- Since the graph is undirected, we need to be careful to avoid infinite recursion due to cycles.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph. We visit each node and edge once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the HashMap and the recursion stack (DFS) or queue (BFS).
