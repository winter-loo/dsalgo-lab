# Hints for Clone Graph

1. This problem requires creating a deep copy of a graph, which means you need to clone both the nodes and their connections.

2. The main challenge is handling cycles in the graph. You need to keep track of nodes that have already been cloned to avoid infinite recursion.

3. Consider using a HashMap to map original nodes to their clones. This allows you to check if a node has already been cloned and retrieve the clone if needed.

4. You can use either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the original graph and create the clone.

5. For DFS approach:
   - Use a recursive function that takes an original node and returns its clone.
   - If the node is null, return null.
   - If the node has already been cloned (exists in the HashMap), return the cloned node.
   - Otherwise, create a new clone, add it to the HashMap, and recursively clone all neighbors.

6. For BFS approach:
   - Use a queue to keep track of nodes to process.
   - Start by cloning the given node and adding it to the HashMap.
   - For each node in the queue, clone its neighbors if they haven't been cloned yet and add them to the queue.

7. In Rust, you'll need to handle ownership and borrowing carefully, especially with the recursive DFS approach. Consider using `Rc<RefCell<Node>>` for shared ownership and interior mutability.
