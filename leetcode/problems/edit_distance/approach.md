# Approach

The "Edit Distance" problem asks us to find the minimum number of operations required to convert one string to another, where the allowed operations are insert, delete, and replace.

## Strategy

This problem can be solved using:
1. **Dynamic Programming**: Build a solution using a 2D DP table
2. **Recursive Approach with Memoization**: Top-down approach with caching

## Dynamic Programming Approach
1. Create a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum operations to convert word1[0...i-1] to word2[0...j-1]
2. Initialize the base cases:
   - dp[i][0] = i (deleting i characters from word1)
   - dp[0][j] = j (inserting j characters from word2)
3. For each cell dp[i][j]:
   - If word1[i-1] == word2[j-1], no operation needed: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
   - Otherwise, take the minimum of:
     - Insert: dp[i][j-1] + 1
     - Delete: dp[i-1][j] + 1
     - Replace: dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
4. Return dp[m][n] where m and n are the lengths of word1 and word2

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) where m and n are the lengths of the two strings
  - We need to fill in each cell of the DP table once
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the DP table

## Pseudocode for Dynamic Programming
```
function minDistance(word1, word2):
    m = length of word1
    n = length of word2
    
    // Create DP table
    dp = 2D array of size (m+1) x (n+1)
    
    // Base cases
    for i from 0 to m:
        dp[i][0] = i
    for j from 0 to n:
        dp[0][j] = j
    
    // Fill the DP table
    for i from 1 to m:
        for j from 1 to n:
            if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j],    // Delete
                                   dp[i][j-1],    // Insert
                                   dp[i-1][j-1])  // Replace
    
    return dp[m][n]
```

## Alternative Approach: Recursive with Memoization
1. Use a recursive function that computes the edit distance between word1[0...i] and word2[0...j]
2. Use memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems
3. The base cases are when one of the strings is empty

This approach is more intuitive but may have higher overhead due to the recursion stack.
