# Hints for Edit Distance

1. Think of the problem as finding the minimum operations to transform word1[0...i] to word2[0...j].

2. Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum operations to convert word1[0...i-1] to word2[0...j-1].

3. There are three possible operations: insert, delete, and replace. For each position, you need to decide which operation leads to the minimum edit distance.

4. Base cases: converting a string to an empty string requires deleting all characters, and converting an empty string to another string requires inserting all characters.

5. When the characters at the current positions match (word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]), no operation is needed, so dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].

6. When the characters don't match, take the minimum of:
   - Insert: dp[i][j-1] + 1
   - Delete: dp[i-1][j] + 1
   - Replace: dp[i-1][j-1] + 1

7. The final answer is dp[m][n], where m and n are the lengths of word1 and word2.

8. You can optimize the space complexity to O(min(m, n)) by using only two rows of the DP table.

9. The time complexity is O(m * n) where m and n are the lengths of the two strings.

10. Consider using recursion with memoization as an alternative approach if you find it more intuitive.
