# Approach

The "Sum of Two Integers" problem asks us to calculate the sum of two integers
without using the `+` and `-` operators.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to find a way to add two integers without using the addition and
subtraction operators. This is a classic bit manipulation problem that requires
understanding how addition works at the bit level.

## Bit Manipulation Approach

At the bit level, addition consists of two operations:
1. XOR (^): Gives the sum of two bits without considering the carry.
2. AND (&) with left shift (<<): Gives the carry bits that need to be added in the next iteration.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Calculate the sum without carry using XOR: `a ^ b`.
2. Calculate the carry using AND and left shift: `(a & b) << 1`.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with the new values until there's no carry left.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the number of iterations is bounded by the number of bits in an integer (32 for a 32-bit integer).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space.

## Pseudocode

```
function getSum(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        carry = a & b
        a = a ^ b
        b = carry << 1
    return a
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the algorithm with a = 2 (10 in binary) and b = 3 (11 in binary):

1. Iteration 1:
   - carry = a & b = 10 & 11 = 10 (2 in decimal)
   - a = a ^ b = 10 ^ 11 = 01 (1 in decimal)
   - b = carry << 1 = 10 << 1 = 100 (4 in decimal)
2. Iteration 2:
   - carry = a & b = 01 & 100 = 000 (0 in decimal)
   - a = a ^ b = 01 ^ 100 = 101 (5 in decimal)
   - b = carry << 1 = 000 << 1 = 000 (0 in decimal)
3. Since b = 0, we return a = 5.

## Handling Negative Numbers

The above approach works for both positive and negative numbers in languages
that use two's complement representation for negative numbers (which most
modern languages do). This is because the XOR and AND operations work on the
bit level, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative.

## Language-Specific Considerations

In some languages, like JavaScript, the bitwise operations convert the operands
to 32-bit integers, which can cause issues with large numbers. In such cases,
we might need to handle the overflow explicitly.

In Rust, the bitwise operations work as expected for 32-bit integers, so we
don't need any special handling.

## Alternative Approaches

### Recursive Approach

We can also implement the solution recursively:

```
function getSum(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return getSum(a ^ b, (a & b) << 1)
```

This approach is more concise but might lead to stack overflow for large numbers in languages that don't optimize tail recursion.

### Using Built-in Functions

Some languages provide built-in functions to perform addition without using the `+` operator, such as `sum` in Python or `add` in C++. However, using these would defeat the purpose of the problem, which is to understand how addition works at the bit level.
