# Hints for Sum of Two Integers

1. Think about how addition works at the bit level.

2. When adding two bits, there are two operations involved: calculating the sum
   bit and calculating the carry bit.

3. The XOR operation (^) can be used to calculate the sum bit without considering the carry.

4. The AND operation (&) followed by a left shift (<<) can be used to calculate the carry bit.

5. For example, when adding 1 and 1 in binary:
   - Sum bit: 1 ^ 1 = 0
   - Carry bit: (1 & 1) << 1 = 1 << 1 = 2 (10 in binary)

6. You need to repeat the process until there's no carry left.

7. Consider using a while loop where you calculate the sum without carry and
   the carry separately, then update your variables for the next iteration.

8. The algorithm terminates when there's no carry left (i.e., when b becomes 0 in the pseudocode).

9. This approach works for both positive and negative numbers in languages that
   use two's complement representation for negative numbers.

10. Be careful with language-specific behavior regarding bitwise operations on negative numbers.
