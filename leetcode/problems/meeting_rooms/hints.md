# Hints for Meeting Rooms

1. Think about what it means for a person to be able to attend all meetings - no two meetings can overlap.

2. Two meetings overlap if one meeting starts before another meeting ends.

3. Consider sorting the intervals to make it easier to identify overlaps.

4. After sorting the intervals by start time, you only need to check if any adjacent intervals overlap.

5. When checking for overlap between two intervals [a, b] and [c, d], they overlap if c < b.

6. Be careful with edge cases, such as when meetings are exactly adjacent (e.g., [1,2] and [2,3]). According to the problem, these are not considered overlapping.

7. Remember to handle the case when the input array is empty - a person can attend all meetings if there are no meetings.

8. The time complexity of your solution will be dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n).

9. You can also solve this problem by checking all pairs of intervals for overlap, but this would be less efficient with a time complexity of O(nÂ²).

10. Consider what happens when there are duplicate meetings (same start and end times) - these would not be considered overlapping with each other.
