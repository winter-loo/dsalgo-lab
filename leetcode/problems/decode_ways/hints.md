# Hints for Decode Ways

1. This problem is well-suited for dynamic programming, as the number of ways to decode a string depends on the number of ways to decode its prefixes.

2. Consider the mapping: 'A' -> "1", 'B' -> "2", ..., 'Z' -> "26". Any valid decoding must use these mappings.

3. For each position in the string, you have at most two choices:
   - Decode the current digit as a single letter (if it's not '0')
   - Decode the current digit and the previous digit together as a letter (if they form a valid two-digit number between 10 and 26)

4. Be careful with '0' digits - they can only be decoded as part of a two-digit number (10 or 20), not as a single digit.

5. A dynamic programming approach can be used where dp[i] represents the number of ways to decode the substring s[0...i-1].

6. The recurrence relation is:
   - If s[i-1] != '0', then dp[i] += dp[i-1]
   - If s[i-2:i] forms a valid two-digit number (10-26), then dp[i] += dp[i-2]

7. Pay attention to the base cases: an empty string has one way to decode (as nothing), and a single digit can be decoded if it's not zero.

8. For optimization, you only need to keep track of the last two values in your DP array, not the entire array.
