# Hints for Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

1. This problem is an extension of the basic stock trading problem, with the added constraint of a cooldown period after selling.

2. Think about the problem in terms of states: on each day, you can be in one of three states - holding a stock, just sold a stock, or in a cooldown/rest state.

3. Consider using dynamic programming where you track the maximum profit for each state on each day.

4. Define your state variables:
   - `hold[i]`: Maximum profit on day i if you are holding a stock
   - `sold[i]`: Maximum profit on day i if you just sold a stock
   - `rest[i]`: Maximum profit on day i if you are in the cooldown period or doing nothing

5. The state transitions are:
   - To hold a stock on day i: either you were already holding it on day i-1, or you were in a rest state on day i-1 and bought on day i
   - To have just sold on day i: you must have been holding on day i-1 and sold on day i
   - To be in a rest state on day i: either you were already in a rest state on day i-1, or you just sold on day i-1 (cooldown)

6. Initialize your states carefully:
   - `hold[0] = -prices[0]` (buying on day 0)
   - `sold[0] = 0` (cannot sell on day 0)
   - `rest[0] = 0` (no profit if doing nothing on day 0)

7. The final answer is the maximum of `sold[n-1]` and `rest[n-1]`, as you cannot end with holding a stock for maximum profit.

8. For optimization, notice that you only need the previous day's states to calculate the current day's states, so you can reduce the space complexity to O(1).
