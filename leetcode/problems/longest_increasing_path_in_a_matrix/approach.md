# Approach

The "Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix" problem asks us to find the length of the longest path in a matrix where the values are strictly increasing along the path.

## Strategy

This problem can be solved using:
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) with Memoization**: Explore all possible paths from each cell
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Build a solution using a 2D DP table

## DFS with Memoization Approach
1. Create a 2D memo array to store the length of the longest increasing path starting from each cell
2. For each cell in the matrix, perform a DFS to find the longest increasing path
3. In the DFS, explore the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if they have a larger value
4. Use memoization to avoid recalculating paths for cells we've already visited
5. Return the maximum path length found

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix
  - Each cell is visited exactly once due to memoization
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the memoization array and the recursion stack

## Pseudocode for DFS with Memoization
```
function longestIncreasingPath(matrix):
    if matrix is empty:
        return 0
    
    m = number of rows in matrix
    n = number of columns in matrix
    memo = 2D array of size m x n, initialized to 0
    
    maxLength = 0
    for i from 0 to m-1:
        for j from 0 to n-1:
            maxLength = max(maxLength, dfs(matrix, i, j, memo))
    
    return maxLength

function dfs(matrix, i, j, memo):
    if memo[i][j] > 0:
        return memo[i][j]
    
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  // right, down, left, up
    maxLength = 1
    
    for (di, dj) in directions:
        ni = i + di
        nj = j + dj
        
        if ni >= 0 and ni < m and nj >= 0 and nj < n and matrix[ni][nj] > matrix[i][j]:
            length = 1 + dfs(matrix, ni, nj, memo)
            maxLength = max(maxLength, length)
    
    memo[i][j] = maxLength
    return maxLength
```

## Alternative Approach: Topological Sort
1. Build a directed graph where there's an edge from cell A to cell B if B is adjacent to A and has a larger value
2. Perform a topological sort on this graph
3. The longest path in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) can be found using dynamic programming after a topological sort

This approach is more complex but can be more efficient for certain types of matrices.
