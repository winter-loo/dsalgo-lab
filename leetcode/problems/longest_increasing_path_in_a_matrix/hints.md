# Hints for Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

1. Think of the matrix as a directed graph, where there's an edge from cell A to cell B if B is adjacent to A and has a larger value.

2. The problem is equivalent to finding the longest path in this directed acyclic graph (DAG).

3. Consider using depth-first search (DFS) with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

4. For each cell, explore all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that have a larger value.

5. Use a memo array to store the length of the longest increasing path starting from each cell.

6. The base case is a cell with no adjacent cells having larger values, which has a path length of 1.

7. The final answer is the maximum path length found starting from any cell in the matrix.

8. Be careful with the boundary conditions - make sure you don't go outside the matrix.

9. The time complexity is O(m * n) where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix, as each cell is visited exactly once due to memoization.

10. The space complexity is O(m * n) for the memoization array and the recursion stack.
