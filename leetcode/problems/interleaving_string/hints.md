# Hints for Interleaving String

1. First, check if the lengths match: if the length of s3 is not equal to the sum of the lengths of s1 and s2, return false immediately.

2. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming, where dp[i][j] represents whether the first i characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2 can form the first i+j characters of s3.

3. The base case is dp[0][0] = true, which means empty strings can form an empty string.

4. For the first row (i = 0), dp[0][j] is true if dp[0][j-1] is true and s2[j-1] matches s3[j-1].

5. For the first column (j = 0), dp[i][0] is true if dp[i-1][0] is true and s1[i-1] matches s3[i-1].

6. For the rest of the table, dp[i][j] is true if either:
   - dp[i-1][j] is true and s1[i-1] matches s3[i+j-1], or
   - dp[i][j-1] is true and s2[j-1] matches s3[i+j-1]

7. The final answer is dp[m][n], where m and n are the lengths of s1 and s2.

8. For space optimization, since each cell in the DP table only depends on the cell to its left and the cell above it, you can use a 1D array and update it in place.

9. Be careful with the indices when checking characters, especially when combining indices from different strings.

10. Consider edge cases, such as when one or more of the strings are empty.
