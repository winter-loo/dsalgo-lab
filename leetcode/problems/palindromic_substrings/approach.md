# Approach

The "Palindromic Substrings" problem asks us to count the total number of palindromic substrings in a given string. This is related to the "Longest Palindromic Substring" problem, but instead of finding the longest one, we need to count all of them.

## Strategy

There are several approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Brute Force**: Check all possible substrings to see if they are palindromes (O(n³) time complexity)
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Build a table to store whether substrings are palindromes (O(n²) time and space)
3. **Expand Around Center**: For each position, expand outwards to find palindromes (O(n²) time, O(1) space)
4. **Manacher's Algorithm**: A specialized algorithm for this problem (O(n) time, but more complex to implement)

## Expand Around Center Approach
1. Iterate through each position in the string
2. For each position, consider it as a potential center of a palindrome
3. Expand outwards from this center in both directions, checking if characters match
4. Count each valid palindrome found
5. Consider both odd-length palindromes (single character center) and even-length palindromes (between two characters)
6. Sum up all palindromes found

## Dynamic Programming Approach
1. Create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the substring from index `i` to `j` is a palindrome
2. Initialize all single characters as palindromes: `dp[i][i] = true`
3. Check for two-character palindromes: `dp[i][i+1] = (s[i] == s[i+1])`
4. For longer substrings, use the recurrence relation: `dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) && dp[i+1][j-1]`
5. Count all cells in the table that are `true`

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Expand Around Center: O(n²) where n is the length of the string
  - Dynamic Programming: O(n²)
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - Expand Around Center: O(1)
  - Dynamic Programming: O(n²) for the DP table

## Pseudocode for Expand Around Center Approach
```
function countSubstrings(s):
    n = length(s)
    count = 0
    
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        // Count odd-length palindromes with center at i
        count += expandAroundCenter(s, i, i)
        
        // Count even-length palindromes with center between i and i+1
        count += expandAroundCenter(s, i, i+1)
    
    return count

function expandAroundCenter(s, left, right):
    count = 0
    
    while left >= 0 and right < length(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
        count++
        left--
        right++
    
    return count
```
