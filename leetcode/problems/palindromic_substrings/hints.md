# Hints for Palindromic Substrings

1. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, "aba", "racecar", and "level" are palindromes.

2. Every single character is a palindrome by itself. For example, in the string "abc", the palindromes are "a", "b", and "c".

3. Think about how you can expand around potential centers of palindromes to find all palindromic substrings.

4. There are two types of palindrome centers to consider:
   - Single character centers (for odd-length palindromes)
   - Between two characters (for even-length palindromes)

5. For each potential center, expand outwards as long as the characters on both sides match.

6. Dynamic programming can also be used: define dp[i][j] to be true if the substring from i to j is a palindrome.

7. For the DP approach, the recurrence relation is: dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) && dp[i+1][j-1]

8. Be careful with the counting - make sure you're counting each palindromic substring exactly once.

9. The total number of palindromic substrings is at least equal to the length of the string (since each individual character is a palindrome).
