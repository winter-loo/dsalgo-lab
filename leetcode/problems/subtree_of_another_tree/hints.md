# Hints for Subtree of Another Tree

1. You can reuse the "Same Tree" algorithm to check if two trees are identical.
2. For each node in the main tree, check if the subtree rooted at that node is identical to the second tree.
3. Consider edge cases like when one of the trees is empty.
4. A recursive approach works well for this problem.
