# Hints for Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

1. Use a depth-first search (DFS) traversal to visit each node in the tree.
2. Keep track of the maximum value seen so far along the path from the root to the current node.
3. A node is "good" if its value is greater than or equal to the maximum value seen so far.
4. The root node is always a good node.
5. Consider using a recursive approach with a helper function that takes the current node and the maximum value seen so far.
