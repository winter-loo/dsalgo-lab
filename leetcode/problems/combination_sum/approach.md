# Approach

To find all unique combinations of candidates that sum up to the target, we need to explore all possible ways to select numbers from the candidates array, allowing for repeated use of the same number.

## Strategy
The most effective approach for this problem is backtracking, which allows us to systematically explore all possible combinations.

## Steps
1. Sort the candidates array (optional but can help with pruning).
2. Use a recursive backtracking function to explore combinations:
   - If the current sum equals the target, add the current combination to the result.
   - If the current sum exceeds the target, stop exploring this path (backtrack).
   - Otherwise, try adding each candidate to the current combination and recursively explore.
3. To avoid duplicate combinations, only consider candidates at or after the current index in each recursive call.

## Implementation Details
- Maintain a current combination and its running sum during the backtracking process.
- For each candidate, decide whether to include it in the current combination.
- Since the same number can be used multiple times, we can consider the same candidate again in the next recursive call.
- To optimize, we can stop exploring a path if the current sum exceeds the target.

## Pseudocode
```
function backtrack(candidates, target, start_index, current_combination, current_sum, result):
    if current_sum == target:
        add current_combination to result
        return
    if current_sum > target:
        return
    
    for i from start_index to candidates.length - 1:
        add candidates[i] to current_combination
        backtrack(candidates, target, i, current_combination, current_sum + candidates[i], result)
        remove candidates[i] from current_combination (backtrack)
```

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^(T/M)) where N is the number of candidates, T is the target value, and M is the minimum value among the candidates. This is because in the worst case, we might need to explore all possible combinations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(T/M) for the recursion stack, where T is the target and M is the minimum candidate value.
