# Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)

There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the **Pacific Ocean** and **Atlantic Ocean**. The **Pacific Ocean** touches the island's left and top edges, and the **Atlantic Ocean** touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the **height above sea level** of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is **less than or equal to** the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return *a 2D list of grid coordinates* `result` *where* `result[i] = [ri, ci]` *denotes that rain water can flow from cell* `(ri, ci)` *to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans*.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: heights = [[2,1],[1,2]]
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]]
```

**Constraints:**
- m == heights.length
- n == heights\[r\].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- 0 <= heights\[r\]\[c\] <= 10^5
