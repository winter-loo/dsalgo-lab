# Approach

To find all possible palindrome partitioning of a string, we need to explore all ways to split the string such that each substring is a palindrome.

## Strategy
This problem can be solved using backtracking, where we recursively partition the string and check if each partition is a palindrome.

## Steps
1. Start with an empty result list and an empty current partition list.
2. Use a recursive backtracking function to explore all possible partitions:
   - If we've reached the end of the string, add the current partition to the result.
   - Otherwise, for each possible substring starting from the current position:
     - Check if the substring is a palindrome.
     - If it is, add it to the current partition and recursively explore the rest of the string.
     - After the recursive call, remove the substring from the current partition (backtrack).

## Implementation Details
- We need a helper function to check if a string is a palindrome.
- The backtracking function takes the current index, the original string, the current partition, and the result list.
- For optimization, we can use dynamic programming to precompute whether each substring is a palindrome.

## Pseudocode
```
function partition(s):
    result = []
    backtrack(s, 0, [], result)
    return result

function backtrack(s, start, current_partition, result):
    if start == s.length:
        add a copy of current_partition to result
        return
    
    for end from start to s.length - 1:
        if isPalindrome(s, start, end):
            add s[start:end+1] to current_partition
            backtrack(s, end + 1, current_partition, result)
            remove the last element from current_partition (backtrack)

function isPalindrome(s, start, end):
    while start < end:
        if s[start] != s[end]:
            return false
        start++
        end--
    return true
```

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * 2^N) where N is the length of the string. In the worst case, there could be 2^N possible partitions, and it takes O(N) time to check if each partition is a palindrome.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for the recursion stack and the current partition, plus O(N * 2^N) to store all valid partitions in the worst case.
