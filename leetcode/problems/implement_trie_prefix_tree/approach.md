# Approach

A Trie (Prefix Tree) is a tree-like data structure that is used to store a dynamic set of strings, particularly for efficient prefix-based operations.

## Strategy
The key components of a Trie implementation are:

1. **TrieNode Structure**: Each node in the Trie represents a character in a word. It typically contains:
   - A boolean flag to indicate if the node represents the end of a word
   - A collection of child nodes, each corresponding to a possible next character

2. **Basic Operations**:
   - **Insert**: Add a word to the Trie
   - **Search**: Check if a word exists in the Trie
   - **StartsWith**: Check if there is any word in the Trie that starts with a given prefix

## Steps for Implementation

### TrieNode Structure
- Create a `TrieNode` struct with:
  - A boolean field `is_end_of_word` to mark the end of a word
  - A collection of children (typically a HashMap or an array) mapping characters to child nodes

### Trie Structure
- Create a `Trie` struct with a root `TrieNode`

### Insert Operation
1. Start at the root node
2. For each character in the word:
   - If the character doesn't exist in the current node's children, create a new node for it
   - Move to the child node corresponding to the character
3. Mark the final node as the end of a word

### Search Operation
1. Start at the root node
2. For each character in the word:
   - If the character doesn't exist in the current node's children, return false
   - Move to the child node corresponding to the character
3. Return true if the final node is marked as the end of a word, false otherwise

### StartsWith Operation
1. Start at the root node
2. For each character in the prefix:
   - If the character doesn't exist in the current node's children, return false
   - Move to the child node corresponding to the character
3. Return true (since we've successfully traversed all characters in the prefix)

## Implementation Details
- In Rust, we can use a `HashMap<char, TrieNode>` to represent the children of each node
- For efficiency, we can use a fixed-size array if we know the character set is limited (e.g., lowercase English letters)
- The `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith` methods will all have a time complexity of O(m), where m is the length of the word or prefix

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Insert: O(m) where m is the length of the word
  - Search: O(m) where m is the length of the word
  - StartsWith: O(m) where m is the length of the prefix
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * m) where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words
