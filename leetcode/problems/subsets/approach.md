# Approach

To generate all possible subsets of a given array, we need to consider each element's inclusion or exclusion in every subset.

## Strategy
There are several approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Backtracking**: Recursively build subsets by deciding whether to include or exclude each element.
2. **Iterative**: Start with an empty set and iteratively add each element to all existing subsets.
3. **Bit Manipulation**: Use binary representation to determine which elements to include in each subset.

## Steps for Backtracking Approach
1. Start with an empty subset.
2. For each element in the array, we have two choices:
   - Include the element in the current subset.
   - Exclude the element from the current subset.
3. Recursively explore both choices for each element.
4. Add each valid subset to the result.

## Steps for Iterative Approach
1. Start with an empty set in the result: `[[]]`.
2. For each element in the input array:
   - Create a new subset by adding the current element to each existing subset.
   - Add these new subsets to the result.

## Steps for Bit Manipulation Approach
1. For an array of length n, there are 2^n possible subsets.
2. Each subset can be represented by a binary number of length n, where a 1 at position i indicates the inclusion of the ith element.
3. Generate all binary numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1 and create the corresponding subsets.

## Implementation Notes
- The backtracking approach is intuitive and easy to understand.
- The iterative approach is often more efficient in terms of code simplicity.
- The bit manipulation approach is the most concise but may be less intuitive.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * 2^n) where n is the length of the input array. This is because there are 2^n subsets, and it takes O(n) time to create each subset.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * 2^n) to store all subsets.
