# Hints for Subsets

1. Think about how to generate all subsets systematically. For each element, you have two choices: include it or exclude it.

2. Consider using a backtracking approach where you make decisions about including or excluding each element recursively.

3. Another approach is to start with an empty set and iteratively add each element to all existing subsets.

4. You can also use bit manipulation: for an array of length n, there are 2^n possible subsets. Each subset can be represented by a binary number where a 1 at position i indicates the inclusion of the ith element.

5. Remember that the input array contains unique elements, so you don't need to worry about duplicate subsets.

6. The empty set is always a valid subset.
