# Hints for N-Queens

1. This is a classic backtracking problem. Try to place queens row by row, ensuring that each placement is valid.

2. A queen can attack any piece in the same row, column, or diagonal. Since we're placing queens row by row, we only need to check for conflicts in columns and diagonals.

3. To check if a position is valid for placing a queen, ensure:
   - No queen in the same column
   - No queen in the same diagonal (row - col is constant for a diagonal)
   - No queen in the same anti-diagonal (row + col is constant for an anti-diagonal)

4. Use sets or arrays to efficiently track occupied columns and diagonals:
   - `cols`: Set of occupied columns
   - `diagonals`: Set of occupied diagonals (identified by row - col)
   - `anti_diagonals`: Set of occupied anti-diagonals (identified by row + col)

5. When you successfully place all N queens, convert the board configuration to the required string format and add it to the result.

6. Remember to backtrack after exploring a path by removing the queen and the corresponding entries from the tracking sets.

7. For small values of N, the number of solutions is manageable, but it grows quickly with N. For example, there are 92 solutions for N=8.
