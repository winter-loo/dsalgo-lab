# Hints for Course Schedule

1. This problem is equivalent to detecting a cycle in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, it will be impossible to finish all courses.

2. Think about how to represent the relationships between courses as a graph. Each course can be a node, and each prerequisite relationship can be a directed edge.

3. There are two main approaches to solve this problem:
   - Depth-First Search (DFS) with cycle detection
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS) using topological sorting (Kahn's algorithm)

4. For the DFS approach:
   - Keep track of nodes being visited in the current DFS traversal
   - Also keep track of nodes in the current recursion stack
   - If you encounter a node that's already in the recursion stack, you've found a cycle

5. For the BFS approach (topological sort):
   - Calculate the in-degree (number of prerequisites) for each course
   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree = 0)
   - As you "take" each course, reduce the in-degree of courses that depend on it
   - If you can process all courses this way, there's no cycle

6. Remember that the input format is different from a typical graph representation. You'll need to convert the prerequisites array into an adjacency list or matrix.

7. Be careful with the direction of edges in your graph. If [a, b] means "a depends on b", then the edge should go from b to a in your graph, not from a to b.

8. Consider edge cases: What if there are no prerequisites at all? What if there are isolated courses with no dependencies?
