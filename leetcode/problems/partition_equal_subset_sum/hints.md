# Hints for Partition Equal Subset Sum

1. This problem is asking if we can split the array into two subsets with equal sums.

2. First, calculate the total sum of the array. If the total sum is odd, we can immediately return false because we can't divide an odd number into two equal parts.

3. If the total sum is even, the problem reduces to finding a subset that sums to exactly half of the total sum.

4. This is a variation of the "Subset Sum" problem, which can be solved using dynamic programming.

5. Consider using a boolean DP table where dp[i][j] represents whether a subset of the first i elements can sum up to j.

6. The base case is dp[i][0] = true for all i, because an empty subset always sums to 0.

7. For each element nums[i-1] and each possible sum j, we have two options:
   - Don't include the current element: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
   - Include the current element: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-nums[i-1]] (if j >= nums[i-1])

8. We can optimize the space complexity to O(target) by using a 1D DP array and iterating backwards.

9. Be careful with the initialization of the DP array and the order of iteration when using the 1D approach.
