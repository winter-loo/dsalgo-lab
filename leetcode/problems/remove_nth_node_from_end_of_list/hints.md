# Hints for Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Key Question

How can you find the nth node from the end without traversing the list twice?

## Additional Hints

1. Can you use two pointers to solve this problem?
2. What if you maintain a gap of n nodes between two pointers?
3. Consider using a dummy head node to simplify edge cases, especially when removing the first node.
4. Think about how to handle the case where n equals the length of the list.
