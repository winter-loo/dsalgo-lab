# Approach for Reverse Nodes in k-Group

This problem involves reversing sections of a linked list. The main challenge lies in correctly managing pointers during the reversal and reconnection steps, especially when dealing with groups iteratively.

## 1. Iterative Approach (O(1) Space)

This approach directly addresses the follow-up constraint of O(1) extra space complexity.

*   **Idea:** Iterate through the linked list, identifying groups of `k` nodes. Reverse each full group and connect it back to the main list. Leave the final partial group (if any) as is.

*   **Pointers Needed:**
    *   `dummy`: A node placed before the actual `head`. `dummy.next` points to the `head`. This simplifies handling the first group.
    *   `group_prev`: The node *before* the current k-group starts. Initially `dummy`.
    *   `group_end`: The last node *within* the current k-group.
    *   `kth_node`: Used temporarily to find `group_end` by iterating `k` steps.
    *   `next_group_start`: The node *after* `group_end`. Needed to link the reversed group to the rest of the list.

*   **Helper: Reversing a Sublist:** You'll need logic to reverse a sublist starting from `start_node` up to (but not including) `end_node`. This typically involves `prev`, `curr`, `next` pointers within the sublist reversal loop.

*   **Process:**
    1.  Initialize `dummy` node pointing to `head`.
    2.  Initialize `group_prev = &dummy`.
    3.  Loop indefinitely (or until the end is reached):
        *   Find the `k`-th node starting from `group_prev.next`. Use a temporary pointer `kth_node` and iterate `k` times.
        *   If `kth_node` becomes `None` during this check, it means fewer than `k` nodes remain. Break the main loop.
        *   If a full group is found, `kth_node` now points to the last node of the group (`group_end`).
        *   Let `group_start = group_prev.next`.
        *   Let `next_group_start = kth_node.as_mut().unwrap().next.take()` (disconnect the k-group from the rest).
        *   Reverse the k-group starting from `group_start` up to `kth_node`. The standard reversal logic applies here. The new head of the reversed group will be the original `kth_node` (`group_end`).
        *   Connect the pointers:
            *   `group_prev.next` should now point to the new head of the reversed group (the original `kth_node`).
            *   The original `group_start` node (which is now the tail of the reversed group) should have its `next` point to `next_group_start`.
        *   Move `group_prev` forward to the original `group_start` node (which is now the end of the just-processed reversed group), preparing for the next iteration.
    4.  Return `dummy.next`.

*   **Complexity:**
    *   Time: O(N). Each node is visited a constant number of times (once for finding the k-th node, once during reversal).
    *   Space: O(1). Only a few extra pointers are used.

## 2. Recursive Approach

*   **Idea:** Define a function that takes the current `head` and `k`. Check if `k` nodes exist. If yes, reverse them and recursively call the function on the `k+1`-th node. Connect the reversed tail to the result of the recursion.

*   **Process:**
    1.  **Base Case:** Check if there are at least `k` nodes starting from `head`. Iterate `k` steps. If not, return the current `head` (no reversal needed for the remainder).
    2.  **Recursive Step:**
        *   If `k` nodes exist, reverse the first `k` nodes. Let the new head of this reversed group be `new_head` and the tail be `original_head` (which was the input `head`).
        *   The `k+1`-th node is the start of the rest of the list.
        *   Recursively call `reverseKGroup(k+1_th_node, k)`.
        *   Connect the tail of the reversed group (`original_head`) to the result of the recursive call: `original_head.next = recursive_result`.
        *   Return `new_head`.

*   **Complexity:**
    *   Time: O(N). Each node is visited a constant number of times.
    *   Space: O(N/k) due to the recursion call stack depth.

## Conclusion

While recursion can be conceptually simpler for some, the iterative approach is generally preferred for this problem because it meets the O(1) space complexity follow-up requirement. The iterative method requires careful pointer manipulation.
