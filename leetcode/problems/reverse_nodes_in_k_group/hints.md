# Hints for Reverse Nodes in k-Group

## Key Questions

*   How can you determine if there are at least `k` nodes remaining starting from a given node?
*   How do you reverse a sublist (specifically, the next `k` nodes)?
*   After reversing a k-group, how do you connect the reversed group back to the previous part of the list and the subsequent part of the list?
*   How do you handle the last group if it has fewer than `k` nodes?
*   What pointers do you need to keep track of during the reversal and reconnection process?

## Additional Hints

*   **Subproblem: Reversing a Linked List:** You'll likely need a helper function or logic to reverse a portion of the linked list. Recall how to reverse a standard linked list using `prev`, `current`, and `next` pointers.

*   **Identifying the k-Group:** Before attempting to reverse, you need to check if a full group of `k` nodes exists. Iterate `k` steps forward from the start of the potential group. If you reach the end before completing `k` steps, you don't reverse the remaining nodes.

*   **Pointers Management:** This problem requires careful management of pointers.
    *   Consider using a `dummy` head node before the actual `head`. This simplifies handling the reversal of the *first* k-group.
    *   You'll need a pointer to the node *before* the start of the current k-group (`group_prev`).
    *   You'll need a pointer to the *last* node of the current k-group (`group_end`). This node becomes the *first* node after reversal, and its `next` pointer needs to connect to the start of the *next* k-group (or the remainder of the list).
    *   You'll need a pointer to the node *after* the current k-group (`next_group_start`). This is where the tail of the reversed group (which was the original start of the group) should point.

*   **Iteration:** Process the list iteratively. In each step:
    1.  Identify the start of the current group (`group_start`, initially `group_prev.next`).
    2.  Find the end of the current group (`group_end`) by advancing `k-1` steps from `group_start`. Check if you reach the end prematurely.
    3.  If a full k-group exists:
        *   Store the start of the *next* group (`next_group_start = group_end.next`).
        *   Reverse the sublist from `group_start` to `group_end`.
        *   Reconnect the pointers: `group_prev.next` points to the new head of the reversed group (which was `group_end`). The original `group_start` node (now the tail of the reversed group) points to `next_group_start`.
        *   Advance `group_prev` to the original `group_start` node (which is now the end of the just-processed reversed group) to prepare for the next iteration.
    4.  If a full k-group doesn't exist, you're done.

*   **Recursive Approach:** This problem can also be solved recursively. The base case is when there are fewer than `k` nodes left. Otherwise, reverse the first `k` nodes and recursively call the function on the rest of the list (`k+1`th node onwards). Connect the reversed head to the result of the recursive call.

*   **Space Complexity:** Pay attention to the follow-up question about O(1) extra memory space. An iterative approach typically achieves this, while a naive recursive approach might use O(n/k) stack space.
