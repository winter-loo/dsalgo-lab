# Approach: Backtracking

## Intuition
To generate all valid combinations of parentheses, we need to ensure that at any point, we don't close more parentheses than we've opened, and that we use exactly n pairs in total.

## Algorithm
We can use a backtracking approach to generate all valid combinations:

1. Start with an empty string and two counters: `open` and `close`, both initialized to 0.
2. At each step, we have two choices:
   - Add an opening parenthesis '(' if we have used fewer than n opening parentheses.
   - Add a closing parenthesis ')' if we have more opening than closing parentheses.
3. When the string length reaches 2*n (n pairs), we've found a valid combination.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(4^n / √n) - This is the nth Catalan number, which represents the number of valid parentheses combinations.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack, plus O(4^n / √n) to store all valid combinations.

## Implementation Notes
- Use recursion to implement the backtracking approach
- Keep track of the number of opening and closing parentheses used
- Only add a closing parenthesis if there are more opening parentheses than closing ones
- Add the combination to the result when it reaches the desired length (2*n)
